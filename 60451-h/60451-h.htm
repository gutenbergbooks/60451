SUICIDE PLACE</p>


<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“IF ONLY&mdash;&mdash;”</span></h2>


<p>When the beautiful Miss Maybelle Maury, of Mount
Vernon, New York, was returning in October, 1894, from
her tour of Europe with her chaperon, Mrs. Vere de
Vere, a New York society leader, she was introduced by
the latter to our hero, handsome young St. George Beresford,
the only son of a New York millionaire.</p>

<p>Life on shipboard offers many temptations to flirtation,
and the fascinating youth did not show himself indifferent
to the challenge that Maybelle’s dark, languishing
eyes immediately flashed into his face. He attached himself
to her party, and made lazy, languid love to the
beauty all the way over.</p>

<p>The chaperon was delighted, and plumed herself not a
little on the probable grand match she had brought about
for her favorite Maybelle. She knew that the girl’s<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
mother, her own distant relative, would be overjoyed at
this lucky turn of Fortune’s wheel. Maybelle was nineteen,
and it was time she was making her matrimonial
market, because she had two younger sisters at school
who must come out in a year or two more, and it would
be so expensive having three girls in society at once, for
the father, though a prosperous New York merchant,
could not be rated among the millionaires.</p>

<p>Our space, however, will not permit us to follow the
progress of Maybelle’s flirtation through those bright October
days upon the sea.</p>

<p>But when the twain parted in New York, St. George
Beresford was invited to visit the beauty at her home in
Mount Vernon, close to the great metropolis, and carelessly
promised to go “some day.”</p>

<p>It was a shame that the handsome rogue forgot all
about it afterward, so that they did not meet again until
the winter, when Maybelle was spending a month in the
height of the season with her New York friend, Mrs.
Vere de Vere.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes flashed with pleasure as they clasped
hands again after those months of separation, and she
cried reproachfully:</p>

<p>“You forgot your promise!”</p>

<p>The laughing brown eyes grew soft with repentance
as he returned, coaxingly:</p>

<p>“Indeed, I meant to come to Mount Vernon, but&mdash;I
went South the first of November with my folks, and
didn’t return until&mdash;well, <em>recently</em>. So now&mdash;will you
forgive me?”</p>

<p>Would she not forgive the deceitful wretch anything,
charming Maybelle, who secretly adored him? She knew<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
that he had only remained South five weeks, but she
flashed him a melting glance, and murmured, sweetly:</p>

<p>“I’ll forgive you, sir, on only one condition&mdash;that you
come in the early spring.”</p>

<p>“Only too glad to promise&mdash;so good of you to permit
me,” cooed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeunesse dorée</i>; and so the flirtation was
resumed, although not very spiritedly on his part. He
was five-and-twenty, and several years in the social swim
had made him shy of pretty anglers for rich catches.</p>

<p>They met at balls, operas, and receptions&mdash;they drove
together a few times, he made several short calls, and
sent her flowers and books, but his frank nonchalance
through it all was not encouraging. It was froth on a
light wave, and even the keen attention of Mrs. Vere de
Vere could detect no latent earnestness.</p>

<p>“He does not seem to mean anything in particular,”
she confided candidly to the girl on the last day of her
stay; and Maybelle laughed and answered that she did not
care&mdash;she had only been flirting with him.</p>

<p>But that night her pillow was wet with tears because of
his careless farewell when he heard she was going.</p>

<p>But she could not banish his image from her warm
heart. Her love, as well as her pride, was enlisted, and
a little spark of hope kept alive in her heart the longing
that he would keep his promise to come in the spring.</p>

<p>But it is more than probable that he would have audaciously
forgotten again, only her brother Otho sought his
acquaintance and attached himself to him, with the result
that he “bagged the game”&mdash;that is, he brought St.
George Beresford to Mount Vernon in May, when the
handsome home on Prospect Avenue, Chester Hill, was
looking its best among its trees and flowers.</p>

<p>Oh, how shyly happy Maybelle was at his coming! The<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
love in her heart made her dusky beauty more dazzling
than ever before. Joy lent a deeper, fuller cadence to her
musical voice. Hope shone again like a brilliant star in
her languishing dark eyes, with their heavy, black-fringed
lashes.</p>

<p>St. George Beresford suddenly found her winning on
him in a subtle fashion and told himself that really she
was growing more charming with each day and hour.
This tenderness and admiration might have ripened into
passion for Maybelle, if only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Ah! those words, <em>if only</em>&mdash;so short, so simple, yet so
fraught with meaning!</p>

<p>Maybelle might have won Beresford’s heart and become
his bride, <em>if only</em> he had not seen, as he lounged at
the gate with Otho Maury, one May morning, that vision
of a blue-eyed, golden-haired, cherry-lipped, dimpled-faced
girl in dark blue flashing past the gate on a shining
wheel, leaving in his heart a memory of the sweetest,
sauciest, most adorable young face in the world.</p>

<p>“Who is she?” he asked, hoarsely, of Otho; who replied,
carelessly:</p>

<p>“Miss Florence Fane, the carpenter’s daughter, nicknamed
Fly-away Floy, by reason of her hoidenish ways
and never did a girl deserve the title more.”</p>

<p>It was that lovely face, dear reader, that brought the
elements of tragedy into my story.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“HEIRESS OF FATE.”</span></h2>


<p>Otho Maury’s tone was light and contemptuous, but
at heart he was furious. He had a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">penchant</i> for Florence
Fane himself, and dreaded a rival in this man whose<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
face had paled at the sight of her, and whose voice had
trembled as he asked her name&mdash;ay, whose very heart
shone in his splendid eyes as he leaned over the gate
watching the flying wheel and its graceful rider like one
in a dream&mdash;a dream of love, for his pulse beat fast, his
heart leaped wildly, his very soul was stirred within him
in strange, delirious ecstasy.</p>

<p>Maybelle came down the graveled walk to them, beautiful
in a dainty white gown with purple lilacs at her slender
waist.</p>

<p>But St. George Beresford did not turn to meet her
gaze, and Otho said, sneeringly:</p>

<p>“Beresford has been struck dumb by the sight of a
beauty on a bicycle.”</p>

<p>“A beauty?” frowningly.</p>

<p>“Yes. Little Fly-away Floy.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, <em>she</em> is no beauty, only a mischievous little
hoiden! Don’t let her turn your head, Mr. Beresford;
she isn’t in <em>our</em> set at all. Her father is a mechanic, and
her mother a seamstress.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, carelessly, turning around and
flashing her a bright, quizzical glance, in which he seemed
to dismiss the thought of Florence Fane.</p>

<p>He was very proud, and did not wish her to know that
he had been fascinated by one so far below him in social
position.</p>

<p>But Maybelle had equivocated, and she hoped ardently
that he would not find it out.</p>

<p>A flavor of romance and mystery hung around Florence
Fane’s origin.</p>

<p>John Banks, the kind-hearted carpenter, had taken the
sobbing child nine years ago from the side of her dead
mother and carried her home to his childless wife, who,<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
because Floy seemed to have no kith or kin, had taken
her into her heart and called her daughter, and both
lavished a world of tenderness on the seven-year-old child.
But save in nobility of nature and a tender heart, she was
no more like the homely pair than a restless humming-bird
is like a toiling honey-bee. She was rarely, exquisitely
beautiful, lovable after an imperious fashion, but
willful and untamable in disposition, the result of spoiling
by a too fond and overindulgent mother, who at the
last had deserted her by fleeing from life’s pains and
penalties by the forbidden path of suicide.</p>

<p>Floy was heiress by her birth to a small estate and to
a terrible taint of blood&mdash;the mania for suicide.</p>

<p>She was a descendant of the Nellest family, that for
forty years had numbered in each decade a suicide among
its members.</p>

<p>The scene of these tragedies was at an old farm-house
on a lonely road two miles from Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>The house, a substantial and somewhat pretentious
structure of rough dark stone, overgrown picturesquely
in many places with creeping ivy, stood back from the
road in a magnificent grove of old oak-trees, and twenty-five
acres of rich farming land stretched away in the
rear.</p>

<p>But so grewsome was the reputation of the place, that
for nine years it had had no tenants, and its name had
changed, by tacit consent of the neighborhood, from Nellest
Farm to Suicide Place.</p>

<p>The Nellest family had owned and tilled this farm almost
a hundred years, but in the middle of the century
the head of the family had committed suicide by cutting
his throat, and just ten years later, his only son was found
hanging from a tree near the spot where his father died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>The widow of the son, with her only daughter, continued
to reside at the farm, employing a competent man
to manage it. But when another decade rolled around,
the neighborhood was horrified to learn that the manager
had shot himself in the head, adding the third to the list
of deaths by suicidal mania.</p>

<p>Horrified and unnerved by all these tragedies, Widow
Nellest fled from the place with her beautiful young
daughter, leaving the property in the hands of a lawyer
for rent or sale.</p>

<p>But neither buyer nor tenant could be found, and successive
crops of weeds ripened and died on the untilled
acres. The poorest beggar would have refused to live
there rent-free.</p>

<p>At almost the end of the next decade the daughter of
Widow Nellest returned to the place in widow’s weeds,
and with a child seven years old. Her mother had died
of a broken heart, she said, and she herself had been married
and widowed.</p>

<p>In spite of the horror of the neighborhood, she took up
her abode at Suicide Place, declaring herself poor and
unable to make a home elsewhere. Here she lived alone
with her child, as neither man-servant nor maid-servant
would have gone inside the gates for love or money.</p>

<p>And here, after a few months’ solitude, Mrs. Fane,
overcome by the terrible, mysterious spirit of the old
place, succumbed to the mania of her family and poisoned
herself.</p>

<p>John Banks, who had been employed by the woman
to mend her gates, heard the frightened shrieks of little
Floy one morning when he came to his work, and most
reluctantly entered the house.</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Fane dead, with a bottle of poison<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
clutched in her stiffened hand. She had been dead for
hours.</p>

<p>The carpenter took the orphan child to his own home,
and into his big, generous heart. Then he reported the
case, after which there was a coroner’s inquest and a
verdict of suicide by poison.</p>

<p>Enough money was found in the house to bury her
decently, and then the old place was left to its grim solitude
again.</p>

<p>This was Florence Fane’s inheritance&mdash;the old farm
that none would rent or buy, and the terrible taint of
blood that made her an object of a romantic interest and
pity to the many who knew what must be her probable
fate.</p>

<p>But, strange to say, the child herself knew and laughed
at these whisperings. She had no superstition in her
make-up; and, although forbidden by her adopted parents
to enter even the gates, she was in the habit of going
secretly to the old house and rambling through it at will.
She even declared that she would go and live there, if any
one would bear her company; but no one accepted her
defiant challenge to fate.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the time was approaching when the grim,
unappeasable Moloch of the place would demand, in all
probability, its fifth victim. It was shunned like the
plague, for all remembered that not only the family, but
one of no kith or kin, had met self-sought death there.
None but Floy ventured near the place&mdash;willful Floy,
who laughed to scorn their predictions that she would be
the next sacrifice. When they tried to reason with her,
she would not listen to their warnings, darting away like
a gay, elusive little humming-bird.</p>

<p>When St. George Beresford turned away from the<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
gate where he had watched Fly-away Floy out of sight,
he knew that his heart had gone with her forever, and
that he never had, and never could love Maybelle Maury
as she wished to have him do&mdash;for he had long since
fathomed the tender secret of her heart. The knowledge
made him feel very pitiful toward the poor girl, and rendered
him so abstracted that she guessed the change in
him directly, and became furiously jealous of her unconscious
rival, merry little Floy.</p>

<p>He tried to smile and chat as usual with Maybelle and
Otho, but his thoughts wandered from them in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>Oh, how strange it was&mdash;how strange! Only a careless
glance from a pair of blue eyes, as the girl had smiled
and nodded at Otho Maury, and all the world had changed
for St. George Beresford. He wondered vaguely if <em>his
glance</em> had made any impression on the girl’s heart.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DASTARDLY PLOT.</span></h2>


<p>The first moment that Maybelle was alone with Otho
she clung to his arm, whispering, sorrowfully:</p>

<p>“Otho, I am wretched! Did you mean what you said
this morning&mdash;that St. George admired that girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I meant it, every word, Maybelle, for it is true,
curse the luck! and unless we carry things with a high
hand, he is lost to you forever. In fact, I never saw a
fellow so hard hit in all my life. He actually turned
white to the lips with emotion, and his voice was hoarse
and strange as he demanded her name; and, of course,
you noticed how <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">distrait</i> and half-hearted he has been all
day?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[14]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I saw it too plainly; but, oh, I can not give him
up! Oh, surely, he would not stoop to <em>her</em>&mdash;so far beneath
him socially! Besides, she isn’t so pretty, either&mdash;only
with a babyish kind of beauty.”</p>

<p>“Not so pretty, Maybelle! Why, now you make a
fatal mistake, underrating the girl’s charms. Half the
fellows are raving over her style; and she could have a
dozen proposals to-morrow, only she laughs them to
scorn, the saucy little darling!”</p>

<p>“You are very enthusiastic, Otho!” she cried, suspiciously.
“Perhaps you are in love with her yourself.
I wish you would marry her to-morrow, and make it
impossible for her to become my rival.”</p>

<p>He flushed, then laughed, answering, coolly:</p>

<p>“Thank you; but the plan isn’t feasible. I shouldn’t
mind making love to the pretty little thing, for she’s
sweet enough to turn any man’s head; but I intend, like
yourself, to marry money when I sacrifice myself on
Hymen’s altar.”</p>

<p>“Oh, brother, I am wretched, wretched! It isn’t alone
for the money I want him. I have had other offers&mdash;rich
ones, too; but I love <em>him</em>, love him, love him! I must
win him or die! All in a minute I feel desperately wicked,
and willing to do anything to win him for my own. I
hate that girl already, and wish her dead! Why does she
not go and kill herself like her mother?”</p>

<p>“Probably she will in the end; but she isn’t unhappy
enough yet.”</p>

<p>“Then let us do something to drive her mad with despair
at once!” cried Maybelle, feverishly, recklessly, her
dark eyes flashing with a tigerish light not good to see.</p>

<p>Otho’s eyes flashed back the same spirit, for his heart<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
was burning with a cruel passion for bonny Floy. Stooping
close to her ear, he whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Suppose I could drive her mad with love for me?”</p>

<p>“Try it, Otho, try it! Begin at once, please!” she responded,
eagerly, hopefully.</p>

<p>“I will, for I fancy she admires me immensely already
by her blushes when I speak to her, and I’ll follow up the
good impression at once, storm the castle of her fancy,
as it were, with ardent love-making, persuade her to elope
with me, perhaps&mdash;oh, a mock marriage, of course! She
is poor, and so she could not be taken <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au serieux</i>.”</p>

<p>She listened without a protest to his diabolical scheme
for wrecking the life of a pure and lovely girl. Oh, a
jealous woman can be so hard and pitiless!</p>

<p>He continued:</p>

<p>“Of course you know she will be at the picnic we attend
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“No! Who dared invite the creature?” imperiously.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! Maybelle, that scorn was well acted before
Beresford to-day; but in private we know that the girl
really has some rights and a sort of footing in our set,
so that we’re apt to meet her at less exclusive functions,
such as this picnic will be. We can not keep from meeting
her to-morrow, but we can forestall Beresford’s suit
by plotting beforehand.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how, Otho, and be sure I will act my part.”</p>

<p>“I am sure you will; but I must first think it over, and
in the morning I will confide my plans to you before we
start for the picnic. And I’ll call at the carpenter’s cottage
this evening. She is always on the porch with her
guitar. I’ll get in her good graces so that I can monopolize
her company to-morrow, and make him think he has
no show with her at all. I’ll throw in some little fibs,<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
too, that he’s engaged to you, etc., so that she will shun
him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Otho, I see. That is a splendid idea, and easy
to carry out. Oh, how I thank you for your clever help
all through!” she cried, in a transport of joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>Otho accepted the praise complacently, but he knew
he was working more for himself than for her.</p>

<p>It would be a most delightful part to play, the making
love to Floy, and as for the rest, he was heart and soul in
the scheme to win a millionaire for his brother-in-law.
He was selfish and extravagant, and always in hot water
with his father about money, so when Maybelle secured
her prize he would make her pay a heavy price for his
help.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WHY DID SHE DO IT?</span></h2>


<p>The next morning dawned gloriously, and in due time
the carriages reached the picnic-grounds&mdash;just a mile
past Suicide Place&mdash;a picturesque grove on the banks of
a river. There was a pavilion and music for dancing,
with every device for pleasure.</p>

<p>And Floy was there with the rest, charming in a white
duck suit and big hat, self-possessed as a young princess,
and not one whit abashed when Otho led her to his party,
and said, graciously:</p>

<p>“You know my sister Maybelle, don’t you? She has
been away a great deal lately, but she remembers little
Fly-away Floy, and this is my friend, Mr. St. George
Beresford.”</p>

<p>They all bowed graciously, and then the quartet sat<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
down together on the river-bank, for all this condescension
was the plot that wicked Otho had unfolded to his
sister that morning. Other couples joined them, while
some danced in the pavilion, and still others swung in the
hammocks under the shady trees.</p>

<p>They talked lightly and desultory on frothy subjects,
as people at picnics usually do, and barely any one but
Beresford remembered afterward that it was Otho Maury
who started the subject of bravery and courage, and contrasted
the difference in man and woman on these qualities
of mind and strength. He exclaimed, finally:</p>

<p>“I adore courage and bravery in man or woman. Indeed,
I would not marry a girl who was a coward&mdash;who
ran shrieking from a mouse, or trembled at the thought of
a burglar&mdash;but I could worship a fearless girl; such a one,
for instance, as would dare to spend a night alone in a
haunted house.”</p>

<p>The pretty girls who heard him all shrieked and shuddered
with dismay&mdash;all except Floy, who shrugged her
pretty shoulders, and said, vivaciously:</p>

<p>“Pshaw! that is not any great thing to do. I shouldn’t
be afraid to stay in a haunted house all night.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you afraid of ghosts, like most young girls?”
asked Otho, incredulously.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not afraid, for I don’t believe in spirits.”</p>

<p>Maybelle laughed tauntingly.</p>

<p>“You are joking, Floy. You wouldn’t dare stay alone
all night in Suicide House&mdash;now, would you?”</p>

<p>The girls all applauded Maybelle, sneering at Floy’s
pretense of bravery, until the impulsive girl saw that they
were overtly challenging her to a proof of her courage.</p>

<p>Flushing with anger, her blue eyes blazing with defiance,
she cried, stormily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“I am not a coward, Maybelle Maury, and I am not
afraid of anything, ghost or human; and I will prove
it to you all by staying alone at Suicide House to-night!”</p>

<p>“No, no; you must not!” cried a few voices, frightened
at the thought of what she had been goaded to do.</p>

<p>But Floy’s high spirit was up in arms, and she would
not be dissuaded from her purpose.</p>

<p>“I shall surely do it, and no one shall prevent me!”
she cried; adding: “When we go home to-night, you
may leave me at Suicide Place, and I will lock myself
in, for I have the keys with me now, and you can go
by and tell auntie I stayed all night with one of the girls.
In the morning you may send a committee to escort me
home in triumph. Why do you all look so pale and
frightened? There is no danger, I tell you; I’ve been over
the house a hundred times alone, and the only ghosts are
rats. It will be rare fun staying there all night!”</p>

<p>No one could dissuade her, so they gave up trying.
Everybody was sorry for it, but Otho and his sister, who
exchanged furtive looks of satisfaction.</p>

<p>St. George Beresford had not spoken a word during
the whole conversation, though his eager, admiring eyes
had scarcely left Floy’s lovely flower-like face. He
was silent, abstracted, bitterly piqued at Floy’s pronounced
indifference to himself.</p>

<p>She had not seemed to see him since the first glance
in which she had acknowledged their introduction by
Otho Maury, and of course he could not know that it was
because Otho had said to her at the cottage gate last
night:</p>

<p>“My sister Maybelle will be at the picnic to-morrow
with her handsome betrothed&mdash;the rich New Yorker she
is to marry this fall. She is as jealous of him as a little<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
Turk, and it makes her angry for any other girl to even
look at him.”</p>

<p>He had counted rightly on Floy’s high sense of honor.</p>

<p>She was a mischievous little madcap, but she respected
Maybelle’s rights, and feigned indifference to Beresford,
although she could not avoid noticing the ardent glance
he threw in her direction, and she thought, indignantly:</p>

<p>“No wonder Maybelle is jealous, for I can see already
that he’s a wretched flirt. I won’t even look at him,
though he is awfully, awfully handsome!”</p>

<p>So with a sigh, whose subtle meaning she could not
understand, she turned her back on the wretched Beresford,
and entered readily into an animated conversation
with Otho, maddening her silent admirer with such keen
jealousy that he could bear it no longer.</p>

<p>“Let us go and dance,” he said to Maybelle, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m too lazy to move. Go and find another partner,”
she laughed.</p>

<p>“But I’m not acquainted with any of the girls here.”</p>

<p>“Otho, go along and introduce him to some girls, and
I’ll stay with Floy and tell her about my lovely trip to
Europe last year.”</p>

<p>Beresford, disappointed in a faint hope that she might
have proffered Floy to him as a partner, went away with
Otho, and Maybelle made herself agreeable to her companion.</p>

<p>At last she observed, patronizingly:</p>

<p>“You’ve never been <em>anywhere</em>, have you, Floy?”</p>

<p>“Not since mamma brought me a little girl back to the
farm,” Floy answered, flushing sensitively, for she felt
the sting in Maybelle’s patronizing tone.</p>

<p>But the latter continued, gently and purringly:</p>

<p>“It’s too bad your having to stay with those poor, hard-working<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
people, isn’t it? Shouldn’t you like to support
yourself, Floy?”</p>

<p>“I should not know how to earn a penny,” murmured
Floy, who was like the naughty Brier-Rose of the poem:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Whene’er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied,
</div><div class="indent0">She shook her head in warning and scarce her wrath could hide;
</div><div class="indent0">For girls were made for housewives, for spinning-wheel and loom,
</div><div class="indent0">And not to drink the sunshine and the flowers’ sweet perfume.
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“But out she skipped the meadows o’er and gazed into the sky,
</div><div class="indent0">Her heart o’erbrimmed with gladness, she scarce herself knew why;
</div><div class="indent0">And to a merry tune she hummed: ‘Oh, Heaven only knows
</div><div class="indent0">Whatever will become of the naughty Brier-Rose?’”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“Suppose I tell you what papa was saying about you
last night?” continued Maybelle.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Floy answered, helplessly.</p>

<p>“He was saying that he needed two new salesgirls in
his big dry-goods store in New York, and he wondered if
any girls in Mount Vernon would like to go. He said he
had thought of you, and that maybe old John Banks
would be glad to have you find a situation and help earn
your own living.”</p>

<p>Floy reddened, paled, then gasped:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Uncle John would like it at all. He
loves me&mdash;he and auntie&mdash;and he doesn’t mind taking
care of me.”</p>

<p>“But you’ll tell him of this offer, won’t you, dear, and
you’ll think of it yourself? Papa says he’ll keep the
place open a week for you,” said Maybelle, who had
suggested the plan to Mr. Maury herself.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell Uncle John,” promised Floy; but she seemed
tongue-tied after that, and went moodily away from Maybelle’s
vicinity to join some other girls, keeping so resolutely<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
away that they did not meet again until that afternoon,
when most of the dancers were resting after dinner
on the banks of the beautiful river.</p>

<p>At heart Floy was cruelly wounded by Maybelle’s patronizing,
but she was too proud to show her pain. Once
St. George Beresford ventured to seek her for a partner
in the dance, but she refused so curtly that he turned
away indignantly, wondering why she was so cold to him
while so kind to others.</p>

<p>“She has plenty of smiles for that shallow Otho. I’d
like to wring his little black neck!” he thought, angrily.</p>

<p>Otho was a cur, indeed, but he was slight and dark
and elegant&mdash;one of those types that very young girls
rave over. Beresford saw that he stood high in Floy’s
good graces, and began to hate him accordingly.</p>

<p>When the couples paired off on the river-bank beneath
the shady trees, there was Maybelle and Beresford, and
next to them Floy and Otho.</p>

<p>Floy was bright and restless, feeling Beresford’s gaze
ever seeking hers, and wondering why it thrilled her so
when she knew it was not right for him to look at any
other than Maybelle, his beautiful, dark-eyed betrothed.</p>

<p>She turned her back on him rather rudely, and exclaimed
to Otho:</p>

<p>“People are very foolish and superstitious. They are
always going on about Suicide Place, and saying that it
must claim another victim soon; and they are even hinting
that I will be the doomed one.”</p>

<p>“That is nonsense. I am sure you are too strong-minded
to yield to such a temptation,” Otho replied, reassuringly.</p>

<p>St. George could not help listening to the sound of the<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
musical voice and watching the beautiful profile when it
turned toward him in her animated talk.</p>

<p>Heavens, how lovely she was! What eyes, what lips,
what dimples, what a mesh of curly, golden hair in which
to entangle a man’s throbbing heart! And yet it was not
simply her beauty that inthralled him, and he knew it.
She had that psychical charm we call personal magnetism,
that is like the perfume to the flower and seems to endow
it with a soul.</p>

<p>He heard her continue, almost defiantly, as if annoyed:</p>

<p>“I wish they would not talk about it, for it makes me
angry. Why should I kill myself? I’m young and gay,
and, in a way, happy! And yet,” musingly, “I suppose,
after all, that the terrible taint of that mania is in my
blood. I am not superstitious, but perhaps it may conquer
me after all, who knows? Do you suppose I shall
ever kill myself?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. You would break a dozen hearts if you
did, mine among the rest,” Otho replied, banteringly, with
a killing glance.</p>

<p>She continued, meditatively:</p>

<p>“They will go on expecting me to commit suicide, of
course, and always selecting the old farm as the scene of
the fifth tragedy. Why should I not choose some other
scene for the final act? This river, say,” pointing to it as
it rippled below the bank, dark and deep and dangerous
in its beauty.</p>

<p>Laughing, she rose to her feet, and he said:</p>

<p>“It seems that fate always demands the sacrifice within
the gates of the grim old place.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? Well, I shall defy the fate to
which I was born, and break the charm of Suicide Place.
If, following the taint in my blood, I must indeed kill<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
myself, I shall disappoint everybody in the location. It
shall not be at the old farm, but&mdash;<em>here</em>!”</p>

<p>Then all at once the startling tragedy happened.</p>

<p>Floy stepped to the edge of the bank with a strange,
mocking laugh on her red lips, and, as if the terrible
mania had seized on her suddenly, red-handed and implacable
as fate itself, she threw up her arms above her
beautiful head, and leaped into the river that divided hungrily
to receive the girlish form, then closed again greedily
over its prey.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE REASON WHY.</span></h2>


<p>Pretty Floy’s startling, unexpected, and terrible action
produced the effect of a thunder-clap on the gay and
thoughtless crowd of young people who witnessed it.</p>

<p>A moment of blank, awed silence ensued, then every
one seemed to join in a cry of alarm and dismay as they
pressed forward to the banks and watched the eddying
circles of water over the deep and dangerous spot where
that lovely form had disappeared from view.</p>

<p>They watched eagerly for the golden head to reappear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Otho Maury sat motionless gazing at the
water, his face marble-white, but in his eyes, beneath
their lowered lids, a strange and devilish gleam of joy,
as he thought to himself:</p>

<p>“How deuced clever in the little girl to hasten the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dénouement</i>
of her life like this! It saves Maybelle and me
a world of trouble.”</p>

<p>As for Maybelle, when Floy sprung into the water, she
uttered one loud, hysterical shriek, and clutched her companion
with both hands, hiding her dark eyes against<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
his shoulder as though she could not bear the sight of the
river.</p>

<p>But in an instant Beresford recovered from his trance
of horror, and struggled to release himself and rise.</p>

<p>But Maybelle clung to him so wildly that he could not
loosen her grasp without hurting the clinging white
hands.</p>

<p>“Do not leave me&mdash;do not leave me, St. George! I
am so frightened!” she wailed, beseechingly.</p>

<p>“Otho! Otho!” called Beresford, sternly; and as
Maury looked around with a dazed expression, he added:
“Come to your sister&mdash;I must save that girl!”</p>

<p>Otho did not stir from his position, pretending not to
understand, and Maybelle tightened her frantic clutch
until he saw that he must use gentle force to release
himself.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, but in common humanity I must
go,” he said, resolutely, and wrenched himself free, rushing
forward, throwing off his coat and hat as he went.
Then, amid ringing cheers, the big, handsome fellow
plunged into the river.</p>

<p>Out of that crowd of perhaps fifty young men he was
the only one that had volunteered to save the drowning
girl, although half a score of them had pretended to
adore her.</p>

<p>As Beresford sprung into the water, Floy’s little head
suddenly appeared above it some distance away from
where she had sunk. He struck out in that direction,
shouting to her to be brave, that he would save her life.</p>

<p>But at the sound of his voice, the girl’s head suddenly
sunk beneath the water again, as though she were determined
to accomplish her purpose of suicide.</p>

<p>Our hero, swimming with strong and gallant strokes toward<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
the spot, made a bold dive down to the depths, but
rose again without Floy.</p>

<p>Directly her head bobbed up again some distance off,
but swimming quickly toward her, Beresford grasped her
where she lay easily floating on the water, not having
realized in his excitement that she had been swimming
furtively under the water, leading him a race for the fun
of the thing, for she was not in the least danger.</p>

<p>Grasping her tightly, he said in hoarse tones, broken
with joyful emotion:</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, I reached you before you sunk again!
It was a terrible thing you attempted, but I shall save you
in spite of yourself.”</p>

<p>Floy laughed softly, and answered in a meek little
voice:</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry now that I did it. I don’t believe I
want to die after all!”</p>

<p>“That is right,” he cried, heartily. “Now, be calm,
and I will take you safely to the shore. Put your hands
on my shoulder easily, like this,” placing them. “Be
cool, and don’t get frightened and clutch at me&mdash;above all,
don’t clasp my neck, for the current is very deep and
strong, and you must not impede my motions. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; and I’ll do as you say. I&mdash;I should have
liked to hold you around the neck, but if you object to it
so seriously, I won’t.”</p>

<p>Was there a tone of exquisite raillery in the girl’s voice?
He looked suspiciously into her face, and saw veiled mischief
in the clear blue eyes. She was not frightened&mdash;not
in the least.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he returned, coolly, but with a fast-beating
heart. “I am sure the experience would be delightful;<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
and if you like to try it after we are safe on land,
I shall be most happy.”</p>

<p>“I hate you!” pouted Floy, and letting her hands slip,
sunk again below the surface.</p>

<p>Terribly alarmed, he dived and brought her safely to
the surface once more, saying, sternly:</p>

<p>“Do not be so careless again, or you may lose your
life.”</p>

<p>To his amazement, she laughed mockingly.</p>

<p>“Swim on and I’ll keep by your side. Don’t be alarmed
over me, for I’ve been doing all this for a purpose. I
can swim like a fish.”</p>

<p>And, to his wonder and chagrin, for he felt himself
grow hot even in the cold water with the thought that he
had suddenly been turned from a conquering hero into
an object of ridicule, Fly-away Floy, the merry little madcap,
swam along by his side as easily and gracefully as
a beautiful mermaid, until they reached the bank, when
he gave her his hand to assist her, and they came again
upon <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>, greeted by admiring cheers from the
onlookers.</p>

<p>While they were in the water, Otho had hurried to
Maybelle, and whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you hold him tighter, you little fool?
If you could have kept him from going to her assistance a
short time, she would have been drowned and out of your
way.”</p>

<p>“I knew it, and I tried to keep him back, but he shook
me off in a rage, and I&mdash;I’m sure he even swore at me
under his breath,” whimpered Maybelle, despairingly.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” grumbled Otho; and then he turned
from her to watch Beresford’s progress, and saw to his
amazement the man and girl clambering up the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>In the silence that followed the rousing cheer of joy
at their return, Floy turned to her dripping cavalier,
saying demurely:</p>

<p>“I thank you from my heart, Mr. Beresford, for your
noble attempt to save my life. I was not in any danger,
it is true, for I can swim like a duck, but of course you
did not know that, and you are just as truly a real hero
as if your brave attempts had indeed saved me from a
watery grave.”</p>

<p>There was a swelling murmur of surprise from all
around her, and one little girl, bolder than the rest, came
up and said:</p>

<p>“Why, Floy, didn’t you intend to drown yourself after
all?”</p>

<p>Floy tossed back her wet curly mass of short ringlets,
and returned merrily:</p>

<p>“Of course not, little goosie; why should I be so silly
as to kill myself, I that am so young and happy? I only
jumped in to frighten you all&mdash;yes, and to test the courage
of a gentleman who told us only this morning how
much he adored physical courage.”</p>

<p>Her accusing blue eyes turned on Otho Maury, and
she said, with light, laughing scorn:</p>

<p>“I thought as you pretended to be so very, very fond
of me, that you would risk your life to save mine, but
you proved yourself a coward after all!”</p>

<p>He was livid with secret, sullen rage, but putting a bold
face on the matter, he answered, carelessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew it was only a trick, and that you could
swim as well as anybody; so I didn’t choose to humor
your fancy to have me jump in the water and ruin my
new fifty-dollar suit, like my friend Beresford here, who,
it’s plain to be seen, is as mad as a March hare at the way<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
he was fooled. Come, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon ami</i>, shall I drive you into
town for some dry clothes?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” returned Beresford, who was indeed
bitterly chagrined at being made the butt of such a joke,
and angrily conscious of cutting such a poor figure among
them all in his drenched clothing. He picked up his hat
and coat and went away with Otho, who returned alone
within the hour, saying that Beresford was in the sulks
and wouldn’t come back.</p>

<p>“And as for you, little mischief,” he said, banteringly,
to Floy, who had been over to a house close by and borrowed
a pretty suit, in which she reappeared as fresh as
a rose&mdash;“as for you, the lordly Beresford will never forgive
you for making him appear ridiculous by jumping
into the river to rescue a girl who could swim as well as
he could. He said he should have liked to shake you for
a naughty, saucy little vixen.”</p>

<p>“Who cares?” returned Floy, gayly, not the least
abashed by Mr. Beresford’s resentment.</p>

<p>When the picnic was over, Maybelle slyly reminded her
of her promise about Suicide Place.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I’m going to spend the night there, certainly,”
she replied; and left the carriage at the gates of
the grim old house, in spite of the remonstrances of many
of the party, who were really uneasy at the thought of
such a daring adventure.</p>

<p>Floy would not listen to any of them; she answered
them with careless, merry banter; and as the carriages
rolled away, they saw her standing inside the gates, waving
her little hand in farewell, her slender, white-robed
figure clearly defined in the gloom of the falling twilight.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DREAM OF ROSES.</span></h2>


<p>Merry little Floy went dancing like a sunbeam through
the dark oak grove, and sat down to rest on the porch
before she entered the house for her night’s vigil.</p>

<p>She rested there while the full moon rose over the tree-tops,
silvering the scene with an unearthly light, and
throwing fantastic leaf-shadows on the short green grass.
It was like an enchanted palace, so calm, so quiet, undisturbed
by any sound save the plaintive call of a whip-poor-will
away off in the dim, silent woods.</p>

<p>She mused a little soberly on the events of the day.</p>

<p>“That big coward, Otho Maury, I was beginning to
fancy myself in love with him, but&mdash;I despise him now!”
curving a red, disdainful lip. “And how I fooled them
all! They really thought I was attempting suicide! Ha,
ha! But how splendid Maybelle’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancé</i> was; how brave,
how cool, and if only&mdash;he wasn’t engaged, I believe I
should have lost my heart to him&mdash;so there!”</p>

<p>Perhaps she <em>had</em> lost her heart to him anyway, in spite
of Maybelle, for she could not get the thought of the big,
handsome, brown-eyed fellow out of her little curly head,
and she recalled with a sudden warm wave of color rushing
to her face the audacious frankness of the words he
had said to her in the water, answering her saucy jest:</p>

<p>“I’m sure the experience would be delightful, and if
you like to try it when we are safe on land, I shall be
most happy.”</p>

<p>Floy had thrilled with sweet ecstasy at his daring
words, and now she said, audaciously:</p>

<p>“Yes, I&mdash;I <em>should</em> like to try it! I should throw
my arms around his big neck and hug him tight, and kiss his<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
sweet, brave lips, the beautiful hero, only&mdash;&mdash;” and the
words trailed off into a deep sigh at the sudden thought
of Maybelle, who stood between them.</p>

<p>And like a dash of cold water came the memory of
Otho’s words.</p>

<p>Beresford was angry with her for the joke she had
played, and would like to shake her for a naughty, saucy
little vixen.</p>

<p>“Let him try it&mdash;that’s all!” she exclaimed, shaking
her bright head defiantly, then leaning it half despondently
on her arm.</p>

<p>Wearied by the pleasures of the long, bright day, she
sunk into slumber.</p>

<p>Sweet dreams came to her there in the fragrant gloom
of the warm spring night.</p>

<p>To her fancy she was walking with St. George Beresford
in a beautiful rose garden.</p>

<p>Overhead there leaned a sky all darkly, beautifully
blue, while little fleecy clouds tempered the golden brightness
of noon.</p>

<p>From afar there came to her the soft murmur of the
sea blended with low, soft music divinely sweet and tender&mdash;the
music of love.</p>

<p>All around her were the rarest roses filling the summer
air with fragrance&mdash;roses intwining shady bowers of
lattice-work, roses wreathing triumphal arches, roses bordering
long winding walks, delicious thickets of roses so
dense that the sun’s rays had not yet dried the dew from
their velvet petals.</p>

<p>On her head was a wreath of pink roses, at the waist
of her beautiful fleecy white gown, were white and pink
ones blended in exquisite contrast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>By her side, with his arm about her slender, supple
waist, walked handsome St. George Beresford.</p>

<p>They were lovers.</p>

<p>And in this beautiful rose garden they seemed to be
as much alone as Adam and Eve were in Eden.</p>

<p>No faintest sound of the great surging, wicked world
intruded on the delicious solitude&mdash;nothing came to their
hearing save the low murmur of the distant sea, that soft
music breathing the soul of love, and the song of birds
mating and nesting in the rose-trees that shook down their
bloomy petals in rosy clouds over every path.</p>

<p>They did not miss nor want the world in this Eden.
They were all in all to each other, this beautiful pair of
lovers.</p>

<p>They roamed here and there with their arms about
each other, speaking but little, only now and then Beresford
would pause to draw her into his arms and caress
her, murmuring between ardent kisses:</p>

<p>“My only love, my bride!”</p>

<p>Beautiful, dark-eyed, jealous Maybelle Maury was
forgotten just as entirely as though she had never existed.
They were blissfully happy in this dream that Floy
was dreaming there that May night in the grim shadow
of Suicide Place.</p>

<p>But suddenly a dark, portentous cloud overspread the
sky, and a low rumble of thunder shook the earth.</p>

<p>The soft voice of the sea changed to a hollow roar, as
though a storm were lashing its waves into fury, and the
tender music wailed itself into silence like the cry of a
broken heart. The winds rose and lashed the rose-trees
in a furious gale, till the air was full of their flying petals
and spicy perfumes. The song-birds fled affrighted, and
their little nests were dashed upon the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I am so frightened! Save me!” sobbed pretty
Floy, clinging to her fond lover, who clasped and kissed
her again, whispering that there was no danger for her
while he was by his little darling’s side.</p>

<p>But at that very moment a flash of lightning irradiated
the gloom, and Floy saw a woman dashing toward her
in insane fury.</p>

<p>She had the dark, beautiful, jealous face of Maybelle
Maury, and she rushed between them and thrust Floy
away.</p>

<p>“Go, girl, go! He is mine, mine, mine!” she was crying,
madly, when all at once Floy awoke, as we do in
dreams at some moment of unbearable grief and woe.</p>

<p>Her dream had been only half a dream, after all.</p>

<p>The moonlight was darkened by clouds, there was low,
rumbling thunder, followed by flashes of lightning, and a
fitful rain was driven into the porch by the wayward
wind, wetting Floy’s face and hands and dress. It was
this that had woven itself in with her dream and awakened
her to unpleasant reality.</p>

<p>Dazed and wondering, she sprung to her feet, and it
was several minutes before she could realize her position.</p>

<p>Then it came to her that Maybelle had dared her to
spend a night alone at Suicide Place, and she had vowed
she would do it.</p>

<p>She had come and fallen asleep on the porch and
dreamed that exquisite dream that was so lovely until&mdash;Maybelle
came.</p>

<p>“How strange that I should dream of Maybelle’s
lover&mdash;and dream that he was <em>mine</em>!” she murmured,
wonderingly, as she hurried into the house out of the
muttering storm.</p>

<p>Fortunately she had brought some matches, and she<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
knew that there was a lamp in the parlor, so letting herself
in, she hurriedly lighted the lamp, throwing its feeble
glare on the dark oak furniture of the long apartment.</p>

<p>“Whew! what a musty old place!” she ejaculated,
throwing open a window, heedless of the fine mist of rain
that came blowing in, mixed with delicious fresh air and
gusts of delicate perfume from great lilac-trees outside
loaded with white and purple blooms.</p>

<p>Then she uttered a cry of dismay and looked back half
fearfully over her shoulder at a piano in a dark corner.</p>

<p>The lid was closed, but from the keys were coming
low, discordant sounds, as of music played by childish
hands all ignorant of time or tune. It was terrible, that
sound, and Floy, who had never known fear before, felt
as if ice-cold water were trickling down her spine.</p>

<p>Then a quick suspicion came to her, and running
straight to the instrument, she threw back the lid.</p>

<p>Several mice that, alarmed by her entrance, had been
running up and down the keys, producing discordant
notes, jumped out upon the floor and ran away into the
dark corners with little frightened squeaks.</p>

<p>Floy laughed aloud merrily:</p>

<p>“Just as I suspected, after my first moment of terror
at that sudden sound. But a cowardly person would have
sworn it was a ghost playing the piano. I wonder if that
discord was the sweet music I heard in my dream?”</p>

<p>She threw herself into a large easy-chair cushioned in
leather, and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“I am not the least bit afraid&mdash;not the least,” she declared
aloud. “But I wish I could go to sleep again and
dream the first half of that lovely dream.”</p>

<p>But slumber refused to visit her eyes again. She felt
preternaturally wide awake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>Rising, she paced up and down the room, listening to
the muttering of the storm outside, and the wild rain
driving against the creaking old windows.</p>

<p>Several old family portraits hung against the walls,
and the eyes of those buried ancestors seemed to follow
her up and down with grim curiosity as she moved to and
fro.</p>

<p>Such a thing will seriously annoy one sometimes. The
eyes of a portrait may take on a living look, and render
one horribly nervous when alone at midnight.</p>

<p>Those following eyes, so persistent in their stare, annoyed
Floy, and gave her the same creepy chill down her
back that she had felt when the mice scurried over the
piano keys.</p>

<p>She could not resist a sudden longing to escape from
the room, and from the grim scrutiny of her pictured
ancestors.</p>

<p>Taking the lamp in her hand, she started out to explore
the house.</p>

<p>Hurrying along the draughty hall, and in and out of
the musty old rooms familiar to her childhood, the girl
tried to dispel the shadow that began to fall on her spirits
like an ominous cloud.</p>

<p>Presently, over the roar of the storm outside, her voice
rang out in a loud, wild, terrified shriek thrice repeated&mdash;then
awful silence.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AT THE DREAD HOUR OF MIDNIGHT.</span></h2>


<p>Half an hour passed by slowly.</p>

<p>The storm was over.</p>

<p>The lightning, thunder, and rain had ceased, and the<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
moon was coming out from the black wrack of clouds
where she had hidden her glory.</p>

<p>Her silver light shone again upon the sleeping world,
and flashed into the parlor window that Floy had opened
before she left the room half an hour ago.</p>

<p>In the sheen of the moonlight, the staring eyes of the
portraits on the wall seemed to be watching eagerly for
their descendant to reappear.</p>

<p>The hall door opened softly, and Floy staggered across
the threshold, bearing the lamp unsteadily in her small
hand.</p>

<p>What a change had come over the sparkling <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">riante</i> face!</p>

<p>She was pale to the lips&mdash;pale as a ghost, as the saying
goes&mdash;and there was a strange expression in her blue
eyes, as if they had looked upon something uncanny.</p>

<p>With an unsteady step, as though she trembled in every
limb, the lamp flaring dismally in her grasp, she dragged
herself across the room to a long swinging mirror between
the windows, and held the light up over her golden head,
looking at herself carefully, as she whispered:</p>

<p>“I wonder if my hair has turned white?”</p>

<p>The words, coupled with her appalling shrieks of half
an hour ago, proved two facts. First, that Floy had sustained
a severe shock of some kind, since only sudden
fright or grief is supposed to whiten the hair in a single
hour; and secondly, that she was recovering from her
alarm, as manifested by her anxiety over her personal
appearance.</p>

<p>The long mirror gave her back faithfully the beautiful
form with the graceful swelling curves of dawning
womanhood, and the lovely face lighted by clear blue eyes,
and crowned by waves of crinkly gold above the frank
white brow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>No, her hair had not turned white, despite the untold
horror that had shaken her soul to the center. Not even
one silver thread shone among the gold.</p>

<p>Floy heaved a long, bursting sigh of intense relief, set
down the lamp, and dropped wearily into a chair near the
window.</p>

<p>The moon’s rays shone in her white face, so pale and
horror-struck, and she saw that the storm was over and
the sky clear again.</p>

<p>“Oh, how much longer must I stay here?&mdash;how long
before the dawn?” she muttered, fearfully, gazing
straight before her into the night, as if afraid to look
back into the grewsome room with its dark, shadowy
corners.</p>

<p>And this was Fly-away Floy, the fearless, with her
nerves of steel, and her contemptuous disbelief in the
supernatural&mdash;this pale, startled creature who had just
looked into the mirror to see if the golden locks of youth
had changed to the frosty ones of age.</p>

<p>What had changed and shaken the careless girl like
this? Would she ever reveal the secret? Or would her
indomitable pride seal her lips?</p>

<p>She leaned out of the window, reaching down and
breaking off great clusters of wet, fragrant lilacs, in which
she buried her stricken face, while low, bursting sobs
convulsed her form&mdash;sobs of abject misery.</p>

<p>Hark! what was that sound? Only the low wind of
the summer night soughing through the trees.</p>

<p>“No,” she cried, dismissing the fancy and springing to
her feet, “it is a step in the hall!”</p>

<p>She clung to the window-sill, looking over her shoulder
with terrified blue eyes, her heart beating wildly against
her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[37]</span></p>

<p>She was half tempted to spring from the window and
seek refuge in flight.</p>

<p>But it was at least ten feet from the ground, and she
did not fancy the idea of making a cripple of herself.</p>

<p>The door was suddenly flung open, and a laughing voice
exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Where are you, Floy?”</p>

<p>The very sound of a human voice was bliss to her after
the long and fearful night.</p>

<p>She sprung up, sobbing with joy and relief, as Otho
Maury entered the room with a lantern.</p>

<p>“So you have come for me! I&mdash;I didn’t guess it was
near daylight yet,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“It isn’t, Floy&mdash;only a little past midnight.”</p>

<p>He came up to her with a jubilant air, and his eager,
dark eyes burned on her face as he continued:</p>

<p>“But I couldn’t rest for thinking of you, Floy, all
alone in this terrible place, exposed to Heaven knows
what dangers! I&mdash;I&mdash;my heart ached for your loneliness,
dear little one, and so I came to share your vigil.”</p>

<p>At the first moment her face had brightened with relief,
but when he came up close she drew back shrinkingly,
and at his words she took swift alarm.</p>

<p>“You have been frightened. I knew you would be,
though you pretended to be so brave. I see the tears on
your lashes. Now, aren’t you glad I came?” triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m glad, for I did wrong to come. I’ve grown
nervous waiting here alone, and you may take me home
at once,” she answered, gratefully, throwing on her hat
and turning toward the door.</p>

<p>“Wait a little, Floy, for there’s a storm coming up. I<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
did not think you would want to go until daylight, when
the committee called for you with a carriage.”</p>

<p>She recoiled, looking at him with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that they did not come with
you&mdash;that you came here alone?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, that was what I told you, Floy. I feared
the storm would frighten you, so I came to remain with
you till morning.”</p>

<p>The wet lilacs at the window shook and rustled as in
a rising gale, but neither heeded it in their excitement.</p>

<p>He pressed closer, and tried to take her hand, but she
drew herself to her full height, the color rushing to her
pale cheeks, her eyes like blue fire.</p>

<p>“Go! leave me at once!” she commanded, imperiously.</p>

<p>“Leave you, Floy&mdash;I can not! Did you not confess
just now that you had grown nervous waiting here alone?
And there were tears on your lovely cheeks when I found
you drooping here. No, darling, I shall stay and cheer
your solitude.”</p>

<p>“Is the man mad, or does he think me an ignorant
child with no knowledge of the world and its ways? Listen,
Otho Maury: you can not remain here through the
night with me, for what would people say to-morrow?”</p>

<p>She seemed to grow taller with each word so bravely
spoken, as she stood before him like an imperious little
queen, her finger still pointing to the door.</p>

<p>But the man made no motion to obey, and his manner
was full of a jaunty <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">insouciance</i> that filled her with indefinable
dismay.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he answered, airily; and his voice sunk
to a tender cadence as he continued: “Darling little
Floy, no one need know of my being here to-night. No
one knew of my coming, and I can slip away just before<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
daylight, don’t you see? Then when the committee comes
you will be found alone bright and happy, and they will
believe your proud boast that you were not the least
afraid to stay alone in Suicide Place.”</p>

<p>“I command you to go at once!” she said, angrily.</p>

<p>“I refuse to obey,” he returned, jauntily; and there
was a streaming fire of elation in his eyes that almost
drove her wild.</p>

<p>“Then I shall go and leave you here!” she said, scornfully,
turning to the door; but he barred her way. “I
can spring from the window!” she cried, moving to it,
and not noticing the rustling of the lilac branches.</p>

<p>“And kill yourself,” he sneered. “No, Floy, you will
not be so rash. You will stay here with me, for I love
you madly, beautiful one! and I came here to be alone
with you where none could interfere, that I might clasp
your lovely form to my heart and kiss your scornful lips
till they yielded to my caresses, till your heart thrilled
to mine with responsive love!”</p>

<p>“Why, I hate you! hate you! hate you! you cowardly
villain, you infamous cur!” raged Floy, tempestuously,
as she tried to rush past him and gain the door.</p>

<p>But Otho was too quick for her, agile as she was.
Rushing forward, he caught her in his arms, pressing her
tightly to his breast, heedless of her wild shrieks of
fear and prayers for mercy.</p>

<p>Struggling fiercely to bend back her fair head and kiss
her crimson lips, the villain did not catch the rustling
sound of the branches at the window, as a man who had
been hiding and listening there came at a bound over the
sill and into the room.</p>

<p>But the next moment Otho’s arms were caught in a
grasp of steel, and a hoarse voice thundered:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>“Release the lady, you vile hound, and take your punishment!”</p>

<p>It was St. George Beresford, raging like a lion in his
fury, and as Maury’s grasp on Floy relaxed, he caught
up the slim, wriggling coward in his athletic grasp, shook
him contemptuously, and flew over to the window.</p>

<p>Floy, raising up her eyes to her noble deliverer, saw
him, pale with revengeful fury, as, with superb strength,
he lifted Maury up to the window and hurled him through
it over the tops of the lilacs far out into the grove.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“FROM THAT SPOT BY HORROR HAUNTED.”</span></h2>


<p>Floy watched the punishment of Otho Maury with
that boundless admiration a woman always feels for
manly strength and power.</p>

<p>She thought that St. George Beresford was the grandest,
bravest, most beautiful hero in the world, and her
heart swelled with gratitude to him for his manly defense
of a helpless girl.</p>

<p>But she was frightened, too, when she saw her persecutor’s
body flying through the air, and she cried out,
shudderingly:</p>

<p>“Oh, you have killed the wretch!”</p>

<p>But her preserver answered, coolly:</p>

<p>“No, indeed; more’s the pity! It’s only a few feet
from the window to the ground. Besides, didn’t you hear
the thud of his body on the soft wet grass? No bones
will be broken, I assure you, though it ought to be his
neck. But, anyway, this will teach him a much-needed
lesson!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<p>And he laughed softly to himself at the ease with which
he had sent Maury spinning through the window.</p>

<p>“Oh, I thank you so much&mdash;so much! I was so frightened!”
faltered Floy, clasping her white hands in the intensity
of her joy, and lifting to him her beautiful, clear
blue eyes.</p>

<p>He smiled at her kindly, thinking to himself that it was
the loveliest face in the round world, and answered:</p>

<p>“It was rather fortunate I came when I did, for I suspected
the fellow had been drinking. That was why I
followed him here when I found out he was coming.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how good you were&mdash;how good, I can never
thank you enough!” cried Floy, putting out her hand to
him in the exuberance of her gratitude.</p>

<p>Beresford clasped the little hand ardently, and longed
to kiss it, but would not frighten her by such a demonstration.</p>

<p>“Poor little soul, she has been alarmed enough already,”
he thought, generously; the pale cheeks and tear-wet
lashes appealing to all the manliness within him.</p>

<p>“And now you will take me home, will you not?”
added Floy, appealingly.</p>

<p>“Yes; for I came here with that purpose, and my
carriage is waiting at the gate. Come,” he said, putting
out the lamp and taking up the flaring lantern left by
Otho Maury, as he moved toward the door.</p>

<p>Floy paused to shut down the window, and followed
him, oh, so gladly, out of that horror-haunted house in
the sweet moist air of the spring night, breathing a sigh
of relief when she found herself going down the graveled
walk, through the grove, by Beresford’s side.</p>

<p>“Oughtn’t we to see&mdash;if <em>he</em> is hurt or killed?” she
murmured, timidly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Beresford answered, carelessly:</p>

<p>“Oh, he is all right. I hear him coming behind us
now.”</p>

<p>And, sure enough, a voice called, humbly:</p>

<p>“Beresford&mdash;Miss Fane! Will you please wait a moment?”</p>

<p>They paused, and saw Otho Maury limping dejectedly
toward them, looking very meek in the bright moonlight
that streamed through interstices of the trees.</p>

<p>Floy’s tender little heart gave a leap of joy that he was
not killed, although she knew that he well deserved it.</p>

<p>He dropped with difficulty on one knee before Floy,
muttering:</p>

<p>“I crave your pardon, Miss Fane, for my rudeness
just now. I swear I meant no harm except to kiss you.
But I had been drinking&mdash;and I will own it&mdash;I was mad
with love for you. But I never should have frightened
you so only that I had drunk too much wine and I lost
my head. I’m glad Beresford threw me out of the window,
for my madness deserved it, though I’m a mass of
bruises, and my ankle is either sprained or broken. But
that does not matter so that you forgive me. Will you?”
contritely.</p>

<p>Floy had the tenderest heart in the world, and Otho’s
repentance was so frank and engaging that she hesitated.</p>

<p>“Do you think I ought to forgive him?” she whispered
to Beresford, with a ravishing little air of reliance
on his judgment!</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and replied, carelessly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps so&mdash;since he asks it.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Floy; and looking coldly at the offender,
she said, proudly: “I forgive you, as you say you
are sorry; but don’t you ever dare speak to me again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[43]</span></p>

<p>She was turning away, with her head held high in
scorn, but he caught at her sleeve.</p>

<p>“One moment, please. I have another favor to ask
of you and&mdash;Beresford,” the last word with a gulp, as if
swallowing his pride with difficulty.</p>

<p>They both stopped to listen, and he muttered:</p>

<p>“Will you both keep the story of this affair a secret?
It will ruin me if it becomes known. My father&mdash;he has
threatened to disinherit me if I do not quit drinking. I
had promised him, but I&mdash;I broke my word to-night.
Then, too, the ridicule of my set&mdash;<em>you</em> know how it could
sting. Beresford, for God’s sake, be merciful, as you are
strong and brave!”</p>

<p>He drooped before them&mdash;craven, abject, appealing, a
cur to despise&mdash;in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Beresford knew that what he advanced was true; the
story of to-night’s offense and its punishment would make
Maury the laughing stock of all who heard it&mdash;would follow
him with its blight through life.</p>

<p>He was disposed to pity the abject suppliant, the depths
of whose meanness his own noble nature could not
fathom.</p>

<p>So he answered, after a moment’s reflection:</p>

<p>“It shall be as the young lady says, of course, though
I must say you do not merit her leniency.”</p>

<p>“I know too well that I do not, but she is an angel,
and will grant my prayer,” muttered the wretched delinquent.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not an angel, and I hate and despise you,
Otho Maury!” flashed the lovely girl, stamping her tiny
foot on the wet gravel. “But I’ll keep your disgraceful
secret as long as you never open your lips to me again.
Do you hear?” angrily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>“I hear, and I’ll stick to the condition, though it’s a
hard one. I had as soon be dead as banished from your
presence,” sighing. Then he looked at Beresford. “And
you?” he said, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’ll never betray you unless you seek to harm Miss
Fane again in any way, even by speaking her name
lightly, as you may in malice be tempted to do. You understand?”
sternly.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I’ll not forget that you have constituted
yourself her protector.”</p>

<p>There was a furtive sneer under the pretended humility
of the answer, but Beresford did not heed it, he merely
said, warningly: “See that you keep your promise,” and
turned away, going down the path with Floy at his side
and out at the gate with her to the waiting carriage.</p>

<p>The craven wretch they had left behind followed more
slowly, for he was indeed sore and bruised from his fall,
and his ankle was twisted from his efforts to alight on
his feet.</p>

<p>But as he had come afoot on his secret nefarious mission
of evil, he was compelled to return the same way,
cursing and groaning at every step with blended pain and
chagrin, for his heart was filled with rage against Beresford.</p>

<p>“Curse him! He foiled my clever plan entirely!” he
raved to himself.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“OH! THOSE HAPPY MOMENTS SPENT TOGETHER!”</span></h2>


<p>Beresford led his trembling young companion out to the
carriage that waited impatiently at the gates, the horses
fretting and the driver swearing under his breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>In fact, the young man had been charged a heavy sum
for this service, the driver sharing to the full the common
terror of Suicide Place.</p>

<p>So it was with a sigh of relief that he received from
Floy the directions where to drive, after which she was
handed into the carriage by her escort.</p>

<p>“With your permission I will see you safely home,”
he said, courteously, springing in after her and closing
the door.</p>

<p>They had something more than three miles to drive to
Bird’s Nest Cottage, and each heart thrilled with the
consciousness of happy moments to be spent together.</p>

<p>As he seated himself by her side, Floy thought of her
exquisite dream of the rose garden, where she had
walked by his side, with his arm about her waist and his
low voice whispering love into her willing and enraptured
ears.</p>

<p>Her heart began to throb wildly, the blood leaped
warmly through her veins, she felt her cheeks flush and
her eyelids quiver in the semi-darkness. She was so
overcome with sweet and painful emotion that she could
not utter a word, and Beresford, thrilling with the same
sweet pain, also remained silent.</p>

<p>He was so madly in love with the little blue-eyed beauty
by his side that it was with difficulty he restrained himself
from clasping the dainty form in his arms and
whispering to her all that was in his heart&mdash;the admiration,
the tenderness, the passion, the yearning to woo and
win her for his worshiped bride.</p>

<p>But the faint remnant of reason remaining to him
whispered, warningly:</p>

<p>“Wait till she knows you better. Such impetuous
violence would frighten and disgust the little darling!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[46]</span></p>

<p>So each remained silent for a brief time, thrilled and
dominated by the presence of the other, then Floy, coming
back to herself by a great effort of will, murmured,
softly:</p>

<p>“You said you came to take me home. Did any one
send you?”</p>

<p>“No; I came of my own free will,” he returned,
gently.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why, that was strange!” she faltered, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” he asked; and there was a tender
meaning in his voice that made her cheeks burn
warmly, and her heart throb again so wildly that she
could not speak. She, who had always been so saucy and
ready-witted, flouting with scorn the flatteries of her admirers,
could not think of any retort, could not unclose
her lips for a coquettish reply.</p>

<p>Finding that she did not reply, her handsome companion
continued:</p>

<p>“I wonder if you would be offended if I should tell
you about a strange dream that warned me to come to
your assistance!”</p>

<p>Floy started and thrilled, remembering her own beautiful
dream, and she found courage to return:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I thought you were too much offended with me
to&mdash;to dream of me! Mr. Maury said you were so angry
with me, you would not come back to the picnic.”</p>

<p>“That was not true. I was a little vexed with you,
I own, but I was going back with Otho; only just as we
stepped outside the gate, a telegram was handed me that
necessitated my return to New York to-morrow, and my
sailing for Europe the next day. The matter so worried
me that I told Otho to go back without me, as I must<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
remain to see to my packing. I did not bring my valet
here with me, and he went alone and made capital of
my absence to tell you that falsehood, the villain!”</p>

<p>“Oh, how I hate the false, cowardly wretch, and how
glad I am that you came when you did. I believe I should
have died with disgust if he had succeeded in kissing
me!” cried Floy.</p>

<p>Beresford wondered if she would be willing to kiss
him; but he did not dare to offer the caress that was
burning on his lips. His strong, true love made him
timid and respectful.</p>

<p>He said, soothingly:</p>

<p>“I do not think he will ever dare to annoy you again.”</p>

<p>“I should think not, or I will tell Uncle John, and he
will punish him,” Floy replied; then added, timidly: “But
the dream that sent you to me?&mdash;I am quite curious over
it.”</p>

<p>“I should like you to hear it, only&mdash;promise me you
will not be angry,” tenderly.</p>

<p>“Of course not. One can not stop dreams. And this
one must have been a good one.”</p>

<p>“It was charming!” he cried, vivaciously.</p>

<p>“Then tell me all about it.” And it seemed to him
that all unconsciously to herself she nestled confidingly
closer to his side.</p>

<p>He also leaned nearer, so that their heads were very,
very close, so close that his warm breath ruffled the
strands of her curly hair and swept her cheek, as he
began:</p>

<p>“In the first place, I was seriously annoyed yesterday
when I heard you answer Miss Maury’s challenge, by declaring
that you would spend the night alone in the
haunted house&mdash;I believe it is said to be haunted, is it not?<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
Although I was almost a stranger to you, and you seemed
to avoid me somehow, I determined to seek an opportunity
to dissuade you from your purpose, and to tell you
frankly how imprudent such an adventure would be. I
even determined that if you refused to listen to me I
would seek out your parents and acquaint them with
your girlish folly.”</p>

<p>“But I have no parents&mdash;only adopted ones, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I heard the story of your life to-day from a
young man who seemed to admire you very much,” returned
Beresford; adding: “But of course that made no
difference, as your adopted parents would exercise the
same authority over you as your own.”</p>

<p>Floy remained demurely silent, smiling to herself at
the thought of how those dear adopted parents always
humored her every madcap whim.</p>

<p>Floy did not answer a word; she listened attentively,
thinking how sweet and musical his voice sounded, and<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
how sorry she was that this charming drive would soon
be over. She could have gone on, and on, and on with
him forever.</p>

<p>But the cross driver, not sharing her predilections,
swore at his horses and whipped them up impatiently,
while Beresford added:</p>

<p>“The telegram drove everything else out of my mind

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“SLEEPING, I DREAMED, LOVE!”</span></h2>


<p>“I dreamed of you,” repeated Beresford, bending
lower over the girl until her fragrant breath floated up
to him, and the magnetism of her nearness enveloped him
in an atmosphere of passionate bliss. “I dreamed, little
Floy, that you and I were alone together, walking in the
most beautiful rose garden in the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Floy, with a delicious start, throwing up
her little hands.</p>

<p>Beresford caught one of them in his and held it tenderly,
as if it had been a little trembling white bird, as he
went on softly:</p>

<p>“Words are too weak to describe the beauties of that
spot.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine it,” thought Floy, recalling her own
dream of roses.</p>

<p>“It must have been in Italy, the sky was so deeply blue,
and the roses so grand,” resumed Beresford. “There
were thickets of roses so dense that the sun’s rays had not
dried the morning dew sparkling on their petals. There
were winding walks bordered with rose-trees; there were
shady bowers wreathed with climbing roses; there were<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
roses on the ground, roses in your hair&mdash;white ones&mdash;and
at the waist of your white gown were pink and white ones
blended.”</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h!” breathed Floy, lost in wonder at the similarity
of their dreams, and she listened breathlessly as he
went on telling her how the far-off sound of the sea had
come to his ears, mixed with the music that breathed
of love&mdash;the same music she had heard in her own dream.</p>

<p>“Oh, how strange, how passing strange!” she sighed
and he answered, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Yes, strange, but sweet, for now I come to the best
part of it. And you must not be offended, Floy&mdash;remember,
you said you would not&mdash;for in my dream we were
lovers&mdash;you and I&mdash;and as I walked, my arm was around
your slender waist, you raised your face to mine, I kissed
it, and called you my love, my bride.”</p>

<p>One moment of thrilling silence, in which they could
almost hear each other’s wild hearts leap with joy; then
Floy cried, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Oh, let me finish the dream for you! Did not a terrific
storm arise and frighten me so that I cried out to
you to save me? Did not a dark, beautiful woman rush
in and thrust us apart?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes! that was how it ended. How strange
that you should guess at so much of my dream, Floy!
But that was the way of it. You clung to me, begging
me to save you, and I assured you that I would; and
just then a beautiful woman&mdash;she had the very face of
Maybelle Maury&mdash;rushed in and thrust us apart with
wild, jealous threats. At that moment I awoke in a cold
perspiration, trembling with alarm, and the memory of
you rushed over me, and I thought of you alone in that
old house so horror-haunted, and your voice seemed calling<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
for me to save you, until I sprung up, threw on my
clothes, and darted from the room, intending to ask
Maury to accompany me and take you away from that
dreadful place.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” breathed Floy, eagerly, as he paused.</p>

<p>“Well, I met Maury’s man-servant in the hall, and on
asking for Otho, was told he had gone out. The man
begged me to follow and bring him back, as he had been
drinking again against his father’s commands, and if it
came to the old man’s ears there would be a terrible row.
He added that Otho had boasted he was going out to keep
an engagement with a lady; but he suspected he might be
found at some gambling hell, as he often frequented such
resorts.</p>

<p>“‘I will bring him back,’ I assured the man; and
rushed from the house, goaded by a frantic suspicion, hurried
to a livery stable through the raging storm, secured
the carriage after a long argument, and reached Suicide
Place soon after the cessation of the storm. You know
all that followed. I followed the light in the window,
and secreted myself in the shrubbery just in time to witness
the entrance of Maury. I heard all that passed between
you, clambered over the sill, and collared the wretch
just in the nick of time.”</p>

<p>“Just in the nick of time!” echoed Floy; and she
added, in a murmur, to herself: “Oh, that blessed dream
that sent him to save me!”</p>

<p>He caught the whisper, and repeated, joyously:</p>

<p>“Yes, that blessed dream, for Heaven must have sent
it to my pillow, forewarning me in dreams of your
peril, that I might hasten to save you. But, Floy&mdash;forgive
me for calling you that so boldly, but it seems <em>so</em>
natural&mdash;-how strange it seems that you could follow my<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
dream in thoughts as you did. You must possess the gift
of mind-reading.”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, hesitatingly, then burst out, solemnly:
“Oh, it’s so strange I can hardly tell you, and
perhaps you will not believe me, but&mdash;I knew all your
dream as soon as you began to relate it. For&mdash;this is the
truth, sir, and not a girlish jest&mdash;to-night I fell asleep
on the porch of Suicide Place before I came into the
house, and dreamed the self-same dream just as you have
told it, word for word.”</p>

<p>She paused, awed and trembling, overcome by the
strange coincidence of her dream.</p>

<p>She heard St. George Beresford laugh low and joyously
to himself; she felt him crush the hand he held
against his throbbing heart, then he whispered, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Oh, happy, happy dream that brought us together!
Let me interpret it, darling little Floy. It means that
we indeed are lovers, that Heaven made us for each other.
Do you not believe it?”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PLIGHTED.</span></h2>


<p>What Floy would have answered to her lover’s ardent
question was lost in the rumble and noise of the carriage
wheels as the driver reined up his horses in front of
Bird’s Nest Cottage, and loudly announced:</p>

<p>“Here we are!”</p>

<p>Beresford handed Floy out, and walked through the
cottage gate up to the door with her, whispering under the
leafy shade of the honeysuckle vines a tremulous question:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[53]</span></p>

<p>“Will you give me love for love, darling Floy? Will
you marry me?”</p>

<p>She tried to draw away the hand he held, murmuring,
agitatedly:</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you have no right to talk to me like this. You
are engaged to Maybelle.”</p>

<p>Her voice broke in a sob, and he put his arm around
her, drawing her close to his side, hoping that the
shadow of the vines was dense enough to prevent the inquisitive
driver from watching their love-making.</p>

<p>“I’m <em>not</em> engaged to Maybelle; never <em>was</em>, either.
What made you think so, my sweet one?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Otho Maury told me so the night before the picnic.
He said you were to marry his sister in the fall.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be shot if I do! That is another of Otho’s lies,
my pet. The wish was father to the statement. But I
never thought of marrying Maybelle, and they know it.
You are my only sweetheart, dearest, and unless you
promise to marry me, I shall sail the seas over with a
broken heart to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she sighed, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“It’s true, dearest, and you must answer me quickly,
for that driver is getting impatient, don’t you know?
And I can not come back for an answer to-morrow, for
I’ll be on my way to New York before your blue eyes see
the light in the morning, and the day after I sail for Europe,
to be absent, at the shortest possible time, a month.
And you won’t be so cruel as to send me away in despair?”</p>

<p>She had always thought, in her maidenly dreams of
love, that she should not answer yes to her lover’s first
proposal; she would keep him in suspense awhile; but at
the thought of the long sea voyage, her tender heart<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
quaked. What if he should be drowned, her darling boy,
and never know she loved him so dearly?</p>

<p>“Answer me,” he pleaded; and she sighed:</p>

<p>“It is so sudden.”</p>

<p>Beresford laughed low and happily.</p>

<p>“Yes, Love was born full grown, was he not? Love
at first sight, and it is delicious so. Oh, Floy, is it hopeless?
Don’t you love me just a little after all?”</p>

<p>“Not a little&mdash;a whole world full,” she whispered, carried
out of herself by his passion.</p>

<p>Just then the gruff driver bawled irascibly:</p>

<p>“Ain’t you never coming, sir? It’ll soon be daylight!”</p>

<p>Beresford caught her in his arms, pressing her tightly
to his heart, as he whispered:</p>

<p>“You hear that impatient wretch! I must leave you,
darling, but I shall be back in a month, and I’ll write you
while I’m gone. Wear this ring, but keep our sweet secret
till I give you leave to speak. I must conciliate my
little world first, you know. One kiss, darling, and
don’t forget your absent boy.”</p>

<p>He kissed the sweet lips a dozen times, and felt her
tears raining down her cheeks till they mixed their salty
taste with the sweetness of her mouth. She could not
speak one word more after her sweet impulsive avowal of
her love, only trembled in his arms, with tears in her eyes
and smiles on her lips, like April weather, till he snatched
one last passionate kiss, and tore himself away.</p>

<p>Floy dashed the tears from her eyes and listened sadly
to the carriage wheels as they rolled away, then turning
back to the cottage door, knocked loudly for admittance.</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to stay all night with the
girls, dearie!”</p>

<p>“I changed my mind,” she answered, softly; then threw
her arms around his neck, laughing, and whispering:
“I’m sorry I disturbed your nap, you dear old darling,
but I’ll creep softly up to my room, and you can go to
sleep again directly, can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hope so; but I’ve not slept well to-night. My
head aches a little. Maybe it will be all right in the morning.
I’m glad you came home to-night, dear, I always
feel better when you are in the house.”</p>

<p>“Do you, Uncle John? Oh, how good of you, when
I’m nothing but a care to you, after all&mdash;a care and expense!”</p>

<p>“Don’t get such notions in your head, Floy. I love
to work for you; that is what I told Miss Maury last
evening, when she called to offer me a place for you in
her father’s great New York store. I told her you should
never go while I lived to take care of you, my child.
But she said you had almost promised to go. Did you?”</p>

<p>“No; not unless you were to drive me away, you dear
old darling! No, I shall never leave you till I am&mdash;married&mdash;no,
not even then, for I shall marry rich, and take
you and auntie to live with me in my grand New York
home.”</p>

<p>“Castles in Spain!” laughed John Banks, incredulously;
but it warmed his fifty-year-old heart to hear her
gracious promises, and to realize how she loved him.<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
He kissed her a fond good-night, and went back to his
couch, where he slept better the few hours before the
early dawn for knowing that his lovely adopted child, the
merry madcap girl, was safe under the cottage roof.</p>

<p>And Floy, as she flew up the steps to her simple room,
felt her heart throb with repentance over the way she
had deceived the kind, trusting old soul, and resolved to
make a clean breast of it in the morning by confessing her
sojourn at Suicide Place.</p>

<p>“And I’ll promise him to never, never, never, set my
foot there again!” she vowed, shuddering at the thought
of all she had endured that night.</p>

<p>“What a terrible night, and what a happy ending!”
she murmured as she sunk among the downy pillows of
her little bed, with her thoughts full of her lover, grand,
noble St. George Beresford.</p>

<p>She could hardly realize her happiness, pretty little
Floy, for only two days ago she had not seen his face,
although now it was the star of her future.</p>

<p>Her head was so full of the events of the night, that
it was a long time before she fell asleep; so she was left
undisturbed in the early morning when Mrs. Banks prepared
her husband’s early breakfast and sent him off
cheerfully to his work on a building two blocks away.</p>

<p>“Don’t call her till she wakes of herself, Mary,” he
said as he kissed his wife good-bye and went away whistling
merrily, though his head was not quite easy of its
strange pain.</p>

<p>So Floy slept on deeply and dreamlessly like a weary
child till the sun was several hours high in the heavens
and the merry birds twittered unheard in the tree at her
window&mdash;slept on sweetly, to wake at last in a confused
haste with a terrible sense of disaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, what is the matter?” she shrieked aloud in fear
and grief, springing up and rushing to the door.</p>

<p>For she had been startled from her calm, sweet sleep
by the unwonted sounds of heavy footsteps lumbering in
at the front door, while over all rose shrill, agonized cries
in a woman’s voice&mdash;cries of bitter bereavement.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN THE MESHES OF HER HUNGRY FATE.</span></h2>


<p>Floy stood scared and trembling at the head of the
stairs, trying to make out what was going on below.</p>

<p>She presently recognized that it was the voice of Mrs.
Banks, uplifted in those grievous cries, and a conviction
of the truth rushed over her mind&mdash;something terrible
had happened to John Banks.</p>

<p>The tender-hearted wife had always been nervous over
his trade of house-builder&mdash;always forebode an accident.</p>

<p>Tears rushed blindingly to Floy’s sweet blue eyes, and
her heart sunk heavily as she thought:</p>

<p>“Poor, poor auntie! Her life-long presentiments are
realized at last.”</p>

<p>For what else could be meant by those heavy, lumbering
steps down-stairs, and those doleful cries in the little
house that was usually so calm and peaceful?</p>

<p>She groped with ice-cold fingers for a loose wrapper,
threw it over her snowy night-gown, and thrusting her little
rosy bare feet into tiny slippers, flew down the stairs.</p>

<p>The little front room seemed full of people.</p>

<p>There were men in working garb, without their coats,
and homely neighbor women with their aprons to their
eyes. There was <em>something</em> covered up solemnly on a
couch, and beside it Mrs. Banks was kneeling, wringing<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
her hands and filling their sorrowing ears with her doleful
cries.</p>

<p>Floy rushed to the couch, but an old woman caught and
held her back.</p>

<p>“It is Uncle John&mdash;I know it! Do not tell me he is
dead!” she moaned.</p>

<p>But it was, alas! too true.</p>

<p>He had fallen from a scaffolding on the third story,
and death had been instantaneous. The true and tender
heart had ceased to beat, the noble nature had passed
from earth to its reward in heaven.</p>

<p>“It was that dizziness in his head made him miss his
footing. I know it. I begged him to stay at home till he
was better, but he said they could not spare him, and now
he is gone from me forever!” wailed the stricken widow.</p>

<p>And by the couch of death she and Floy mingled their
anguished tears together, both so bitterly bereaved of
their loved one and their only supporter.</p>

<p>For when the first days of grief had passed, and their
dead had been laid away to rest in the grave-yard beneath
the sweet spring flowers, these two, the lonely woman and
the helpless girl, had to look the future in the face.</p>

<p>The faithful hands that had toiled for them, the loving
heart that had shielded them, these, alas! were no more,
and grim poverty stalked into the little cottage now, a
guest they could not thrust away.</p>

<p>The carpenter had worked faithfully all his life, but
his meager savings had all been swept away by the failure
of a savings bank to which he had trusted them. During
the last two years of financial panic and stress he
had been much out of work, and lately he had just caught
up with the rents again, and given his wife and Floy
their simple spring outfits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>There was nothing, nothing for them to look to but the
labor of their hands. Poor Floy did not know how to do
anything useful, they had spoiled and petted her so, and
Mrs. Banks, who did plain sewing for the neighbors sometimes,
knew that all her profits would not pay the cottage
rent.</p>

<p>When the funeral expenses had been paid out of the
money for her husband’s last job, there remained to the
poor woman only the simple furniture of the tiny cottage
and five dollars in her purse.</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” she sobbed, pitifully.</p>

<p>It was then that Maybelle Maury came to the rescue.</p>

<p>“Mamma will employ you in her house as a seamstress;
and papa will give Floy a place as salesgirl,” said the
dark-eyed beauty, cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, I can not be parted from my child!” exclaimed
the unhappy widow, tearfully.</p>

<p>Maybelle curled an imperious lip, and answered:</p>

<p>“That is nonsense! You can not keep Floy with you
now. She will have to earn her living like other poor
girls!”</p>

<p>Floy, sitting over at the window in dreary silence,
thought, exultantly:</p>

<p>“Wait till my lover comes back from Europe, Miss
Maybelle, and see! Oh, it will break your proud heart
when St. George Beresford marries me! And how he
will laugh when I tell him of her grand airs now!”</p>

<p>She longed to startle Maybelle now by telling her that
she would have no need to work for her living, that she
was soon to marry a millionaire’s son, and could take
care of Mrs. Banks in luxury; but she remembered that
Beresford had told her not to betray their secret till he
gave her leave, because he must first propitiate his own<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
little world. So she kept back the words, and at last
said, with a careless little air that angered Maybelle
deeply:</p>

<p>“We may as well accept these positions now, dearest
auntie, and try to bear the separation as best we can for
awhile, but after I am married, and that may be before
long, you shall come and live in my new home, and we
shall be as happy as possible without our dear lost one!”</p>

<p>She could not forbear this little boast in her resentment
against proud Maybelle, and the beauty looked at her
angrily while Mrs. Banks exclaimed in smiling astonishment:</p>

<p>“Married&mdash;married! Why, who ever put such a notion
in that little giddy head? Who would marry a child
like you?”</p>

<p>“A child, auntie? Why, I was seventeen the day before
the picnic, so I’ll be eighteen my very next birthday,
and many a girl is married before eighteen. Why, I may
be engaged already for all you know to the contrary&mdash;although
I don’t swear that I am!” concluded Floy, fearing
she had said too much, and not intending to arouse
their suspicions.</p>

<p>But Maybelle, who knew from Otho all that had happened
at Suicide Place the night when his dastardly plans
had been foiled by Beresford’s timely appearance, trembled
with inward rage and fear, suspecting Floy’s thinly-veiled
meaning.</p>

<p>Otho had left no stone unturned to find out all that had
happened to Floy after Beresford took her away that
night.</p>

<p>The carriage-driver had been ferreted out and interviewed,
although he had nothing to tell except that he
had driven the pair to Bird’s Nest Cottage as fast as he<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
could, and that they had lingered and parted at the door
like lovers, with a kiss.</p>

<p>In the story of that kiss all was told.</p>

<p>Otho knew that St. George Beresford, unlike the generality
of rich young men, was a man of honor.</p>

<p>No young girl’s ruin lay at his door.</p>

<p>He might flirt in a careless, non-committal way if invited
to it by a pair of bold eyes, but he never trespassed
the proprieties.</p>

<p>Maybelle had led him on as far as any, for she was one
of the most accomplished coquettes of the day; but his
bearded lips had never pressed the bloom from her lips
and cheeks. If languishing eyes had dared and tempted
him to the feast, he had most successfully resisted the
temptation.</p>

<p>So Otho and his sister, knowing Beresford’s honor and
Floy’s purity, knew full well the meaning of that kiss.</p>

<p>It was the sacred pledge of their solemn betrothal.</p>

<p>Ay, though they had known each other scarcely twenty-four
hours, they had instantly recognized each other as
soul-mates; their hearts had leaped together and melted
into one beneath the burning sun of Love.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“When Love, like a red rose, burns and blushes,

</div><div class="indent1">The thirsting passions that in them live.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Otho, mad with love for Floy, and Maybelle for Beresford,
knew that something terrible indeed must happen
if these two were to be prevented from marrying.</p>

<p>Nothing short of Floy’s death or dishonor would keep
the proud young aristocrat from making her his worshipful
bride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>Maybelle, in the madness of her jealous love, hated
Floy with a terrible hate.</p>

<p>She felt that she had come very near to winning Beresford’s
love just before he met Floy.</p>

<p>And she vainly imagined that with Floy removed from
her path, she might yet succeed in her heart’s desire.</p>

<p>Love, ambition, and jealousy combined had transformed
Maybelle from a merely selfish, domineering girl
into a relentless fiend. She felt as if she would like to
murder innocent Floy with her laughing blue eyes, and
her saucy, winning smile so frank and ready. Why should
this girl, socially her inferior, and with only a babyish
kind of beauty, have won in one brief, fateful day the
prize that Maybelle had schemed for long, weary months,
and which she would have sold her soul to win?</p>

<p>When she thought of Floy’s possessing Beresford for
her very own, of the love and caresses she craved being
lavished on the little beauty, she felt as if her heart
leaped into her throat and choked her. She grew lividly
pale with emotion.</p>

<p>She could not speak for a moment after Floy’s little
boast, and the young girl continued, lightly:</p>

<p>“But, auntie, we needn’t really be parted at all. Why
can’t we go and live together at Suicide Place? It’s
mine, you know, and much grander, after all, than Bird’s
Nest Cottage. There is plenty of nice, old-fashioned furniture
too, and I’m sure we could be comfortable. What
do you say?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Banks almost fainted at the bare idea.</p>

<p>“Oh, my pet, I’d make any sacrifice in the world for
you, except that one!” she cried, in horror; and so Floy
fell into the meshes of her hungry fate.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THROWN ON THE WORLD.</span></h2>


<p>Mrs. Banks was wretched at the thought of being
parted from Floy, whom she loved as dearly as if she
had been her own child.</p>

<p>Tears sprung to her eyes, and she cried piteously:</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Maybelle, how can I let my child go into
that great wicked city of New York, with all its terrible
temptations to a poor girl who has to earn her bread!
Couldn’t I go, too, and watch over her young life?”</p>

<p>“How could you go? Floy will only earn five dollars
a week, and that will barely provide her board, lodging,
car-fare, and clothing,” answered Maybelle.</p>

<p>“Good heavens! I should say not,” cried Mrs. Banks,
in dismay. “But, oh, I did not mean to live on Floy’s
small earnings. Couldn’t I get work in the city, too? If
we had only one little room together, we could be happier
than apart.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I should not mind it so much if only you could
be with me, dear,” added Floy, eagerly.</p>

<p>But Maybelle was relentless.</p>

<p>The success of the plot she had in her mind depended
on the separation of these two, who seemed to have no
one in the world but each other.</p>

<p>So she persisted in throwing cold water on all the
woman’s plans, declaring that there were thousands of
women out of work and starving in the great city, and
that her father was doing Floy a great favor in giving
her this position when hundreds of others would have
been so glad to get it.</p>

<p>“And mamma can recommend Floy to a good lodging-house,”
she added. “It is kept by a woman who used to<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
keep house for us when I was a child. She married a
car-driver, and went to live in New York. She has been
keeping a salesgirls’ boarding-house ten years, and they
have a charming home with her, I am sure. So Floy
will be as safe with her as under your own protection.”</p>

<p>“And you think she is a good woman, and will be
kind to my poor child, Miss Maybelle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” earnestly.</p>

<p>“That takes a load off my mind, I assure you, and I
will write this woman a special letter, or perhaps I had
better go with Floy to New York myself and talk with
this Mrs. &mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Horton,” said Maybelle.</p>

<p>“Yes, Horton&mdash;thank you.”</p>

<p>“Very well&mdash;if you can spare the money for the trip&mdash;although
a letter would do just as well, and papa
would take Floy to New York with him any morning and
put her in the woman’s care.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he would be so kind?” exclaimed Mrs.
Banks, reminded by Maybelle’s hints of her scarcity of
money, and thinking that she had better save what she
had for a little nest-egg for Floy to take with her in case
of sickness or other needs, for her salary would be such
a miserable pittance.</p>

<p>In the end, Maybelle persuaded her to send Mrs. Horton
a letter instead of going to New York herself, so at
parting with Floy she pressed the five-dollar bill into the
girl’s hand, whispering tenderly:</p>

<p>“You may need it, dear.”</p>

<p>Floy thrust it back, crying out:</p>

<p>“It is your little all, I can not take it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you must, my darling, for I shall have more
from the sale of the furniture, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>Floy kept it reluctantly. She vowed that she never
would use it except in case of direst need.</p>

<p>And so with tears in her eyes, and her sweet bright
face clouded with trouble, she parted from the good
woman who had been like a mother to her for almost ten
years, and went her way to the city with Mr. Maury, who
was acting in good faith toward the girl, and did not
dream that his son and daughter, in begging him to give
Floy a place in his store, were only using him as a tool
to further the nefarious designs they had against the poor
girl’s happiness.</p>

<p>But the pair of plotters were in haste to get in their
cruel work, for they knew that St. George Beresford did
not expect to remain away more than a month.</p>

<p>In that month they must accomplish the task they had
set themselves&mdash;to build a wall between Floy and Beresford
too high for either to scale, in short, to make that
parting at the cottage door an eternal separation.</p>

<p>Maybelle had called at the cottage with her father to
see Floy off, and when the parting was over she turned
to the sobbing Mrs. Banks, and asked, curiously:</p>

<p>“What was it that she ran back to whisper to you at
the last moment?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Banks did not dream how much was involved in
her answer. She thought it a matter of little moment,
and answered, carelessly:</p>

<p>“She told me that if any letters came for her to
Mount Vernon to send them to her at once in New York.”</p>

<p>“So she has a correspondent?” Maybelle muttered,
jealously.</p>

<p>“Why, no, indeed, miss; I don’t believe the child ever
received a letter in her whole life. I think she must
have meant it for fun, for who would write her a letter?<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
She has no relations that she knows of, and no real
friend but me, poor little one!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps she has a clandestine love affair.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, Miss Maybelle; I’m sure not. She was
only joking.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Banks, I must go now. Shall I tell
mamma that you will come to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“If you please, miss, for I shall get things ready to
have the auction sale of my household effects in the
morning.”</p>

<p>Maybelle hurried away, and her next interview was
with the letter-carrier for that district.</p>

<p>She told him that Florence Fane had gone to New
York to live, and had requested her&mdash;Miss Maybelle
Maury&mdash;to receive any letters that might come to her
address. He was to deliver them privately to her keeping,
that her aunt might not discover the correspondence
she was carrying on.</p>

<p>The carrier promised compliance.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“AS PROUD AND AS PRETTY AS A PRINCESS.”</span></h2>


<p>Floy was taken to Mr. Maury’s palatial store, on one
of the most prosperous business thoroughfares of New
York, and given a position behind the handkerchief
counter.</p>

<p>Her genial, sunny nature, always looking at the bright
side of everything, soon attracted admiring friends among
her fellow employés, and made her popular with the
elegant customers who patronized the well-known importing
house.</p>

<p>She was so frank, so pretty, so engaging that it was a<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
pleasure to be waited on by such a girl, who, while eager
to please, did not feel abashed by the notice of the stately
ladies of the grand Four Hundred, nor permit herself to
be patronized by them. She had a rare and graceful dignity,
this wild rose of a girl, that repelled insolence and
patronage alike. When her fellow salesgirls twitted her
on her air of easy independence, declaring that it would
give offense, she tossed her shining head and answered,
saucily:</p>

<p>“Why, I am as good as they are, so why should I
cringe to them? Money is the only difference between
us.”</p>

<p>They laughed at her; but in their hearts they admired
her independence, and they said among themselves that
there was not a rich girl who came to the store half as
pretty and dainty as merry little Floy, in her cheap blue
dress that set off to such advantage her flower-like face,
and tiny dimpled hands with their exquisite taper fingers.</p>

<p>Floy would not own even to herself that she really
occupied a very subordinate position in the world, for
there was some proud blood in her veins that made her
hold her little head high; and, besides, didn’t she know
in her heart that she was engaged to the son of a millionaire&mdash;the
dearest fellow in the world, too, who was
coming back in a month to claim her for his happy bride?</p>

<p>She said to herself blithely enough that this selling
handkerchiefs across a counter was only an episode in her
life, brought about by the jealous malice of Miss Maybelle
Maury, and that it would soon be over forever.
Next year she would be coming to Maury &amp; Co.’s in her
own liveried carriage to buy the costly handkerchiefs
of web-lace and fine embroidery. How the girls she<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
worked with now would stare and nudge each other with
surprise when she appeared!</p>

<p>She had a foretaste of this one day when a beautiful,
brown-eyed woman sailed up to the counter and set all
the clerks whispering to each other.</p>

<p>How grand she was, how stately! and her gray gown
was a Parisian importation&mdash;all the girls knew that, even
Floy, though she had been in New York barely a week.</p>

<p>The lady asked for lace handkerchiefs in a musical
voice that made Floy’s heart leap wildly, while the
frankly admiring brown eyes made her blush like a wild
rose; the voice and the eyes were so like&mdash;so like those
that Floy dreamed of every night.</p>

<p>She was a little nervous while she displayed the beautiful
handkerchiefs; some of the girls noticed it, and they
whispered to one another that Floy was losing some of
her saucy independence, and was overawed at last by a
Fifth Avenue swell.</p>

<p>The lady was very kind and gracious, and she looked
admiringly at the lovely salesgirl while she counted out
the money&mdash;something over a hundred dollars&mdash;to pay
for the dainty trifles she had purchased. As she was
turning away, she said:</p>

<p>“Send the package to Mrs. Beresford, No. &mdash; Fifth
Avenue.”</p>

<p>Then Floy comprehended instantly that the handsome,
gracious lady was none other than St. George Beresford’s
mother.</p>

<p>She gazed after her almost yearningly till she had
passed through the street door, then turned to replace
the boxes of handkerchiefs on the shelves.</p>

<p>And as she did so, she noticed that the lady had carelessly<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
left her well-filled purse on the counter under a
drift of snowy lawn.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, breathlessly, catching it up and
rushing in swift pursuit.</p>

<p>The footman was just opening the carriage door for
his lady when Floy appeared, her sweet face like a rose,
her hair a tangle of gold in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Madame&mdash;Mrs. Beresford&mdash;your purse! You left it
on the counter!” she cried, incoherently.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, my dear,” answered the lady,
turning and taking the purse, and the girl’s hand with it.
Gazing admiringly at Floy, she laughed sweetly, and exclaimed:
“Do you know how I chanced to forget it?
You are so very pretty, I kept staring at you as if you
were a picture until the purse must have dropped unconsciously
from my hand. It was very good of you to run
after me with it, and I shall reward you with some of the
contents.”</p>

<p>And she was opening the dainty gold-mounted <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">porte-monnaie</i>,
when Floy’s little hand closed it impetuously.</p>

<p>“No, no, you must not&mdash;I can not accept it!” she exclaimed,
confusedly, but with a little imperious air that
bespoke secret indignation; and with a courteous bow to
the surprised lady, she hurried back into the store.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford entered her carriage, feeling somehow
as if she had been gently snubbed, and saying to herself,
half smiling:</p>

<p>“The saucy little thing! I should have thought she
would be glad to get five dollars so easily. I should
have liked to reward her for her honesty, too, for some
girls would have been mean enough to keep the purse.
There’s five hundred dollars in it, too, that I brought out
to spend on a bridal gift for Cousin Marion. But that<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
girl, so lovely and dainty, made me forget everything.
She’s proud enough and pretty enough for a princess, and
it’s a pity she’s poor, for beauty is too often a curse to
a poor salesgirl.”</p>

<p>When Floy ran back to finish putting away the handkerchief
boxes, several curious girls hastened to help her
and to congratulate her on having made such a handsome
sale to Mrs. Beresford.</p>

<p>“She’s as rich as cream and peaches&mdash;her husband has
so many millions he can’t count ’em,” declared one,
rashly.</p>

<p>“Her house is a marble palace on Fifth Avenue. We
will go out with you to see it Sunday, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t she make you a present for returning her
purse?” queried another curious one.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” Floy answered, proudly.</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t take it. I saw her push Mrs. Beresford’s
purse back with so queenly an air that the lady
stared with surprise,” laughed Nell Jarley.</p>

<p>The girls all made great eyes of wonder, and one said
that Floy should have taken the reward.</p>

<p>Floy only listened, and smiled like one in a sweet waking
dream. She was charmed with the gracious beauty of
her lover’s mother, and she thought, with tender pride:</p>

<p>“When I am his wife I will create as much sensation
as she does when she comes here to shop.”</p>

<p>And just then one of her mates said, carelessly:</p>

<p>“With all that money, the Beresfords have only two
children, a son and daughter, to inherit it.”</p>

<p>“Is&mdash;is&mdash;the son married?” asked Floy, timidly; and
they all laughed.</p>

<p>“What a question! Are you thinking of setting your
cap for him, princess! No, he is not married yet, though<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
they do say he has fallen in love with Mr. Maury’s eldest
daughter. She is very lovely and stylish, and comes here
often. St. George Beresford comes here, too, with his
mother now and then. He is perfectly splendid.”</p>

<p>Floy wondered, with a throbbing heart, what they
would say if they knew that she was betrothed to this
grand Beresford.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A CRUEL PERSECUTION.</span></h2>


<p>Floy went home that evening from the store with a
blithe heart.</p>

<p>The meeting with St. George Beresford’s mother had
been a delight to the innocent girl.</p>

<p>The great lady’s graciousness had thrilled her with
hope.</p>

<p>She remembered how anxiously her lover had admitted
that he must conciliate his little world before his
marriage.</p>

<p>It seemed to her simple mind that Mrs. Beresford had
been won over already.</p>

<p>“She told me I was pretty&mdash;that she was looking at me
as if I had been a picture; she can not be angry with her
son for loving me,” she murmured, sagely, and she decided
that if he should write her a letter from abroad she
would answer it at once, telling him all that had happened
since their parting and of her pleasant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i> with his
charming mother.</p>

<p>Dimpling with happy smiles, the fragment of a love-song
on her rosy lips, Floy climbed the uncarpeted stairs
to her own poor little den, away up under the eaves in the<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
fourth story, where a minute later she was followed by
her landlady, pudgy Mrs. Horton.</p>

<p>The woman carried in her hand a beautiful bunch of
roses and a letter.</p>

<p>“These came for you awhile ago, Miss Fane,” she said,
blandly.</p>

<p>“From whom?” exclaimed Floy, in surprise.</p>

<p>“Some of your beaus, I suppose. Better read the letter
and see,” the woman returned good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Floy tore it open with nervous fingers, and read these
words written in an elegant masculine hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear little Floy</span>&mdash;I can not rest under the ban of your
anger.</p>

<p>“We used to be such good friends before that night at Suicide
Place that I think you might forgive my folly when I was so
drunk I did not realize what I was doing&mdash;nothing worse, after
all, than trying to steal a kiss from the sweetest lips in the world.
Many a pretty girl has forgiven a little fault like that in an
adoring lover.</p>

<p>“Ah, will you not forgive me and be friends again?</p>

<p>“I am coming to call on you this evening to take you to the
Garden Theater if you will accompany me. The play is ‘Trilby’&mdash;of
course you’ve read that wonderful ‘Trilby’ that has made
such a sensation&mdash;and I think you will enjoy it. Do not refuse,
I beg of you.</p>

<p>“Be ready when I call&mdash;I send you some roses for you to wear&mdash;and
I promise you a charming time.</p>

<p class="ir2 p-1">“O. M.</p>

<p class="p-1">“Union League Club, New York,<br />
<span style="padding-left:4em">May 21st, 1895.”</span></p></div>

<p>Floy stood motionless and pale to the lips, gazing at the
letter as if it had been a Gorgon’s head and had turned
her to stone.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Fane, I hope it’s not bad news!” cried the
landlady.</p>

<p>Floy roused herself from her trance of indignation, and
answered, angrily:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Horton, if a gentleman calls for me this evening<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
you will kindly tell him I am not at home. As for
these flowers, you may have them or throw them out of
the window.”</p>

<p>“Thank you kindly, miss,” replied the woman, taking
them down to ornament her stuffy little parlor.</p>

<p>And there Otho Maury found them when he made his
call. He crushed an oath under his black mustache as he
asked, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Is Miss Fane at home?”</p>

<p>“Lor’, Mr. Maury, are you the one that sent her the
flowers?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, coldly.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I’m sorry to tell you, but she burned your letter
and gave me the roses, and told me to say she was not
at home!” blurted out Mrs. Horton, in her amasement
at Floy’s antagonism to this charming exquisite.</p>

<p>Otho repressed his rage, and said, gratingly:</p>

<p>“That’s strange. Wonder how I have offended the
young woman? She used to be awfully fond of me at
Mount Vernon. There’s some misunderstanding, and if
I could see her one moment I know I could set it straight
with the pretty little vixen. Mightn’t I just go up and
knock at her door?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see as there’d be any <em>great</em> harm, sir. It’s the
fourth flight, No. 19.”</p>

<p>Floy had forgotten to lock her door after Mrs. Horton
went, she was so angrily intent on setting a match to
Otho’s letter.</p>

<p>“How dare he persecute me so?” she cried, with flashing
eyes as she watched it shrivel to ashes.</p>

<p>The tea-bell rang, but she did not heed it. She was too
excited to be conscious of hunger.</p>

<p>She lighted her lamp, bathed her hot face, brushed out<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
her tangled curls, then raised the window and looked
down into the street at the motley crowds beneath the
glaring lights.</p>

<p>She was startled from a long reverie by the soft opening
and closing of her door.</p>

<p>Turning about with a cry of alarm, Floy saw Otho
Maury standing with his back against the door, an insolent
smile of triumph on his lips.</p>

<p>“Floy, let me speak to you one moment,” he pleaded
humbly.</p>

<p>“No, I will not listen. How dare you come up here?
Leave the room this instant, you villain!” she cried out
in stormy anger.</p>

<p>“By Heaven, I will not go, you pretty little vixen, till
you hear me. Oh, Floy, I love you; I offer you my heart
and protection! Will you accept them? No! Then I
swear I’ll have the kiss you denied me that other night!”</p>

<p>Maddened with passion for the scornful young beauty,
he advanced toward her, and in her terrible fright at the
thought of his loathed caress, she leaned her slight body
far over the sill, and sent her voice ringing down to the
street in agonized shrieks:</p>

<p>“Help! help! help!”</p>

<p>“Oh, horror! horror!”</p>

<p>It was Otho who cried out then, for the girl suddenly
lost her balance and plunged headlong through the window,
going down, down, down, through the dizzy distance
to a terrible death!</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE FAIR DEAD FACE HE HAD LOVED SO WELL.</span></h2>


<p>“My God, the girl will be instantly killed!” groaned
Otho Maury, with blanched lips, and staggering like a
drunken man as he reeled backwards to the door.</p>

<p>For even in the horror and remorse of the moment,
knowing that he had caused Floy’s death as certainly as
though he had plunged a dagger in her heart, a swift,
prudential consideration restrained him from following
his first impulse to rush to the window and watch the
doomed girl’s terrible plunge to destruction.</p>

<p>“I must not be suspected of having caused her accident
by my persecutions,” he thought, in alarm for his
reputation.</p>

<p>A blind impulse of flight seized upon him, and, trembling
with horror, his face ashen white, his evil black eyes
staring blankly before him, he made his exit from the
room and the house without encountering any one.</p>

<p>As he gained the street he heard a tumult of excited
voices, but his guilty conscience would not permit him to
join the crowd that was collecting on the pavement.</p>

<p>Wickedly as he had plotted against the poor girl’s happiness,
he felt that he could not bear the sight of her poor
mutilated body with all the sweet, saucy beauty crushed
out of the poor dead face.</p>

<p>If it were Maybelle now, she would gloat over the sight
in her joy that her beautiful rival was dead.</p>

<p>But it was different with Otho, for deep in his heart
burned a mad passion for bewitching Floy.</p>

<p>Though he had plotted with his sister to destroy her,
it was her soul <em>he</em> meant to wreck, not her beautiful
body. <em>That</em> he worshiped with doting admiration, and
had hoped to win.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[76]</span></p>

<p>It almost seemed as if the hands of angels had been
outstretched to foil his nefarious designs, and to draw
Floy back, pure and unspotted, to heaven.</p>

<p>With these thoughts raging in his excited mind, Otho
fled in horror from the scene, and to drown his haunting
remorse, spent the night in a drunken orgie with some
boon companions, who took him to his hotel in the “wee
sma’ hours ayant the twal,” and consigned him to the
porters to put to bed.</p>

<p>At noon of the next day he awoke with the usual large
head incident to such dissipations, and swore at himself
for a besotted fool, after which he ordered brandy and
soda and breakfast.</p>

<p>When he had been bathed, and shaved, and dressed,
he still remained pale, tremulous, and shaken, for the
horror of last evening had rushed freshly over his mind.</p>

<p>“She is dead, poor little Floy, so pretty and so gay,
like a merry little humming-bird ever on the wing&mdash;dead,
and Maybelle will rejoice at the news, but as for me, I
must ever bear about with me a load of remorse that will
drive me to madness,” he groaned, as he rang the bell
for the morning papers, nerving himself to read an account
of the tragedy.</p>

<p>It was there, on the first page of the paper they brought
him, in glaring head-lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">A Plunge to Death!</span></p>

<p>“A Beautiful Young Girl Falls from the Fourth-Story
Window of Her Home on Adams Street, and is Removed
to Bellevue Hospital in a Dying Condition.</p>

<p>“As newsdealer Herr Spiel was dozing last evening in
a chair by his news-stand on Adams Street, he was startled<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
from his dreams by hearing something fall with a
dull thud on the awning above his head, and springing to
his feet, saw with consternation a beautiful young girl
roll off the awning down to the pavement.</p>

<p>“At first sight the girl seemed to have escaped without
injury after her fearful fall, for she rose to her feet
very quickly, and stood looking about her with a half-shy
smile, as if hoping that no one had noticed her accident.</p>

<p>“But in the next moment the pretty face grew pale,
the smile faded, and with a groan she sunk unconscious
to the earth.</p>

<p>“She was Miss Frances Fane, a boarder in the house,
and had in some inexplicable manner fallen out of her
window in the fourth story. She was removed to Bellevue
Hospital in an unconscious condition, believed to be
due to internal injuries, and will probably die.”</p></div>

<p>Otho Maury read the paragraphs with working feature,
for he knew that the victim was Floy, although a
mistake had been made in her name, giving it as Frances.</p>

<p>“So she will die, poor little girl, poor little Fly-away
Floy,” he muttered, heavily. “Indeed, it is a marvel that
she escaped instant death. Heigho! I must go home to-day,
and carry the news to Maybelle.”</p>

<p>And Otho swept his hand across his eyes to shut out
the vision of a fair dead face that he had loved so well
in its living beauty, so gay and sunny.</p>

<p>Then he remembered that Mrs. Vere de Vere had told
him yesterday that Maybelle was coming to New York
to-day. So he hurried to Fifth Avenue, and found her
just arrived.</p>

<p>He drew her aside to tell her what had happened to<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
Floy, and even his callous nature was shocked at her
savage glee.</p>

<p>“What a cruel heart you have, Maybelle!” he cried
in disgust.</p>

<p>She flashed him an angry look, and answered:</p>

<p>“I am no worse than you, Otho. Remember what a
fate you plotted for the girl! She is better off as it is,
for death is better than dishonor.”</p>

<p>“A fine sentiment,” he gibed, wondering if she thought
herself quite honorable, as she had connived at the plot.</p>

<p>She read his thought, and tossed her head defiantly,
thinking how glad she was that Floy was out of her way,
by whatever means.</p>

<p>Otho sighed, and said:</p>

<p>“If you are going back to Mount Vernon to-morrow,
perhaps you will break the news to Mrs. Banks? Poor
soul!”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not go so soon. Besides, we need not
hurry. Better wait till all is over. If she found out before
Floy died, she would want to come down here and
see her, and mamma could not really spare her now. She
is busy with the summer sewing,” Maybelle answered,
heartlessly.</p>

<p>“I must be going,” he said, with a tortured sigh, remorse
heavy at his heart.</p>

<p>“No, stay, and go with us to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matinée</i> to see
‘Trilby.’ Mrs. Vere de Vere has invited a little box
party&mdash;the Van Dorns and the Beresfords. Join us, and
you may get in a word with Alva Beresford.”</p>

<p>“Hang Alva Beresford!” he replied, with the impatience
of pain.</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Otho. You know you said you would<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
help me catch St. George if I would perform a similar
office for you with Alva.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know; but when did she get back from Paris
and her painting?”</p>

<p>“Oh, weeks and weeks ago, and they say she has fitted
up a magnificent studio at home and paints away all the
time, as if she had to work for a living.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, what’s the use of my making up to such
a girl? She has refused every fellow in society, I’m told.
And she’s getting quite a spinster&mdash;bachelor girl, I mean&mdash;isn’t
that the latest fad?”</p>

<p>“Alva is twenty-seven, that’s a fact&mdash;nearly three years
older than her brother&mdash;but she is still the most magnificent
beauty in New York, and will have millions at her
father’s death. She is devoted to her daubing&mdash;‘wedded
to her art,’ she calls it&mdash;but she’s only a woman after all,
and some day she will lose her heart, of course. And
why not to you, Otho, as well as another?” cried Maybelle,
eagerly.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“CUPID.”</span></h2>


<p>Otho Maury joined the theater party to see “Trilby,”
and devoted himself to the beautiful brown-eyed Alva
Beresford, who looked like a young princess, and accepted
his devotion with the careless patronage of one
who knows that homage is her due.</p>

<p>It was her first meeting with Otho, and she read him
at sight, and despised him accordingly, perhaps fathoming
his designs on her fortune as she had already fathomed
Maybelle’s efforts to insnare St. George.</p>

<p>The Beresfords tolerated Maybelle without admiring<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
her, and they were not pleased with the rumor that St.
George was the young girl’s suitor. They had higher
views for the noble, handsome son of the house.</p>

<p>So perhaps it was with a spice of malice toward Maybelle
that Alva said, gayly, in a pause between the acts:</p>

<p>“Do you see how sober mamma looks? She had a
great fright this morning.”</p>

<p>“Alva!” cried that lady, with a reproving nod; but
her daughter, who was at times very volatile, laughed
at her, and continued:</p>

<p>“She received her first letter from my brother, written
on shipboard, and mailed at Queenstown. He perpetrated
a terrible joke on mamma, declaring that he is in love
at last.”</p>

<p>She saw the hot color flame into Maybelle’s cheeks, and
continued, maliciously:</p>

<p>“St. George is contemplating a shocking <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i>.
He is in love, he says, with a pretty little nobody, poor as
poverty, and wild as a deer. He intended to postpone
his confession until his return a month hence, and beg
our consent to his marriage, but his heart is so full he
can not wait. He begs mamma to write and give him
some hope that she will approve his choice.”</p>

<p>“Who is she?” Mrs. Vere de Vere inquired, trying to
keep the blank look out of her face, her feelings stirred
for Maybelle’s sake.</p>

<p>“He did not tell us her name or home, much to mamma’s
regret, as if she only knew where to find her she
would go and buy off her claims on St. George before he
returns.”</p>

<p>“Alva! Alva!” cried her mother, remonstratingly; but
the daughter, who really regarded the whole affair as a
huge joke of her brother, who seemed still but a boy to<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
her maturer age, simply bubbled over with laughter, and
continued:</p>

<p>“As it is, mamma is seriously contemplating an immediate
trip across ‘the pond’ to persuade her boy out of
his fancy, or to detain him abroad until his lovely
charmer wearies of waiting his return and bestows her
affections elsewhere.”</p>

<p>At her light, merry tone every one laughed, and Mrs.
Van Dorn said, consolingly:</p>

<p>“I dare say it is only some pretty little actress, that
he will forget in a week.”</p>

<p>“I only hope so,” sighed Mrs. Beresford; and then
Mrs. Van Dorn, pitying her embarrassment, turned the
conversation into other channels.</p>

<p>They talked of books and art, and now Mrs. Beresford
could turn the tables on mischievous Alva.</p>

<p>“I shall punish Alva finely for telling my secret woes!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Every one turned to her eagerly, and she continued:</p>

<p>“You see, Alva is painting a Cupid, but she can not
find a face to please her; and yesterday I saw a little salesgirl&mdash;in
your father’s store, by the way, Miss Maury&mdash;who
had an ideal face for the picture. Such a face! all
dimples and roses, blue eyes, and rings of golden hair on
the graceful boyish head. And her smile&mdash;it was something
to dream of were one a man&mdash;saucy, sweet, enchanting&mdash;such
a smile as Cupid himself might wear when
drawing his bow to transfix a heart. Well,” drawing a
long breath, “I meant to go to-morrow morning and
secure this little beauty as a model for Alva’s Cupid, but
to punish her now I shall not do so, so the charming
picture will never be painted.”</p>

<p>“You cruel mamma, I shall go and find her myself<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
to-morrow, and you will be balked of your revenge!” exclaimed
Alva, with sparkling eyes; and for the rest of the
time she could think of nothing but the lovely face she was
going to secure for her Cupid.</p>

<p>Otho whispered to Maybelle:</p>

<p>“It must have been Floy that she saw at father’s
store.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered; and exulted in her heart that
the fair Cupid face had lost its roses, the blue eyes their
happy light, the rosy mouth its witching smile, all faded
in death.</p>

<p>Then the curtain raised again, and they turned to watch
the mimic woes of “Trilby” and her lover.</p>

<p>Otho watched with dull, glazed eyes, that saw through
all the glare and brightness the face of one lost to him forever,
and when the actors recited the griefs of “Pauvre
Trilby,” his heart echoed “Pauvre Floy!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE BERESFORD PRIDE.</span></h2>


<p>In the letter that Alva Beresford treated as a merry
jest, St. George had poured out the tenderness of a love-freighted
heart to his mother.</p>

<p>When he parted from Floy that night beneath the
vines on the cottage porch and hurried away to perform
the mission on which he was sent across the sea, his heart
was full of her grace and beauty, and every hour seemed
leaden-winged that kept him from her side.</p>

<p>“How beautiful she is, how far above all others in her<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
ineffable grace and charm!” he said to himself every
hour; and in his impatience to have her for his own he
could not wait till his return to propitiate his mother, for
whose sympathy he yearned with the eagerness of a
loving son. He determined to write to her and plead
his cause.</p>

<p>He knew, alas! all the Beresford pride, and how high
it soared. Had not Alva’s heart been crucified on its
altar?&mdash;gay, mocking Alva, in whose past lay the story
of a broken love-dream never to be resurrected now, for
he was dead, the young poet lover whose suit her parents
had scorned when Alva was a budding girl, fit incarnation
of a poet’s dream. It was only a few months later that he
died&mdash;of a lingering fever, said the physicians&mdash;of a
broken heart, vowed the girl, flinging it frantically in her
parents’ face in the desperation of her keen despair.</p>

<p>Well, the key was turned on that past. Few knew
the story of its bitter pathos, but St. George recalled it
now with something like terror&mdash;prophetic terror.</p>

<p>He cried to himself, resolutely:</p>

<p>“They shall not break my heart on the rack as they
did poor Alva’s. I am a strong man, she was only a weak
girl. I will never give up my heart’s love as she did, and
drag out a cynical life, enjoying nothing, giving all my
soul to cold, lifeless art in lieu of a broken love-dream.
No, I shall marry pretty Floy, my heart’s darling, and our
life shall be ideally happy.”</p>

<p>So he mused while pacing the steamer-deck the long
starlit nights, and one day the letter was written to his
mother, telling of his love, and begging for her approval.</p>

<p>Then he wrote to his little sweetheart&mdash;the first letter
he had ever penned to her, and it was so full of his love
and hope, that, had Floy received it, her heart would have<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
thrilled for joy at the story it told&mdash;the story that
blanched Maybelle’s cheek with rage, for she, according to
her plans, received Floy’s letter from the postman, and
ruthlessly broke the seal in the solitude of her chamber.</p>

<p>And how jealously her bosom throbbed, how ashen
grew her cheek, as she read the burning words of love
written to her innocent little rival, bonny Floy.</p>

<p>It seemed to her that a love so true as that expressed
in those pages could never be turned aside from its object
save by some fateful tragedy. Floy seemed to fill
his heart to overflowing.</p>

<p>He left the ship at Queenstown, and posted his letters.
Then, having attended to some business in Ireland, he
crossed over to London to pursue his mission, counting in
his heart every day and hour until he should receive answers
from Floy and his mother, for he had begged them
for immediate replies.</p>

<p>And every day he wrote again to Floy&mdash;love letters full
of the tenderness that thrilled his heart.</p>

<p>A week passed, then another, and he knew the time
had come when he might begin to look for letters if his
correspondents were prompt.</p>

<p>It was now three weeks since he had left New York,
but his hope of returning in a month was nipped in the
bud.</p>

<p>The business on which his father had dispatched him
dragged wearily along, and did not promise to turn out<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
successfully. His lawyer said frankly that it would very
likely detain him another month.</p>

<p>Just as he was beginning to chafe impatiently over the
delay, came the anxiously awaited letter from his mother.</p>

<p>Oh! how eagerly he broke the seal, the color flying to
his face, his heart beating like a trip-hammer.</p>

<p>For he longed for the approval of his family on his
choice, longed for them to love and admire pretty Floy
as he did, longed to take her to the great stately home
where she would be like a glancing sunbeam in the grand
surroundings.</p>

<p>He snatched the letter from its thick perfumed envelope,
and his eager brown eyes glanced down the thickly-written
pages penned by the hand of his beautiful, proud
mother.</p>

<p>How could she be so cruel to the boy she loved so
dearly?</p>

<p>Had she forgotten the tortured heart of Alva, that she
could doom her son to a like anguish?</p>

<p>Poor Alva&mdash;belle, beauty, and heiress&mdash;yet&mdash;<em>poor</em>
Alva!</p>

<p>Whispering in her empty heart the name of one that
died heart-broken for her sake!</p>

<p>Yes, the pride of birth and wealth that had stood between
Alva and her happiness now threatened shipwreck
also to her brother’s bark of love.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford, in a passion of imperious anger, denounced
the weakness and folly of her son.</p>

<p>She wrote, bitterly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are a man, and of course I can not forbid you from
making the dreadful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i> you contemplate, but I can say
positively, from your father and myself, that should you persist
in your determination to wed this nobody&mdash;whose very name you<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
were ashamed to mention&mdash;you will cut yourself off from our
love and recognition, and also from inheriting one penny of the
Beresford millions. As you have nothing to look to but the small
legacy you had from your grandfather, perhaps this will bring
you to your senses. Doubtless it will cure that scheming adventuress
of her fancy for you&mdash;some second-rate actress, at the
best, I suppose&mdash;and you had as well advise her of the change
in your prospects should you follow your insane desire to marry
such a creature! Our determination on this point is unalterable.”</p></div>

<p>Every scathing word sunk deep into her son’s heart,
and with an inarticulate cry of anger and pain, he tore
the offensive letter into ribbons, and cast it beneath his
feet, trampling it as if it had been a living serpent.</p>

<p>“I might have known it!” he cried, bitterly. “They
did not spare poor Alva, and they will not spare me!
But I am not a child as my sister was. I will show them
I am made of sterner stuff!”</p>

<p>He raged up and down the floor, his eyes blazing with
insulted pride.</p>

<p>Though he had destroyed the letter, he could see in his
mind’s eye every offensive word standing out clearly, as
though traced with a pen of fire.</p>

<p>He muttered in savage wrath, blended with wounded
pride:</p>

<p>“Such cruel epithets&mdash;‘this nobody’&mdash;‘this scheming
adventuress’&mdash;‘some second-rate actress’&mdash;‘such a creature’&mdash;oh,
shame! that my lovely, innocent, pure-minded
Floy should be insulted thus! Well, I will show them
how I will come to my senses!”</p>

<p>He threw himself down at a table with his face on his
arm, his broad shoulders heaving with emotion.</p>

<p>Long minutes passed while he fought the battle between
filial duty and affection and the strong love of his life&mdash;strong<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
and eternal, though such a short time ago he had
not seen her face nor heard her name.</p>

<p>Love had passed over his soul like a torrent, bearing
everything before it. To some deep natures love comes
like this, and then it is either a tragedy of pain or a heaven
of bliss.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Love scorns degrees. The low he lifteth high;
</div><div class="indent0">The high he draweth down to that fair plane
</div><div class="indent0">Whereon, in his divine equality,
</div><div class="indent0">Two loving hearts may meet.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Beresford lifted his head, his face transfigured with its
passionate love and wounded pride.</p>

<p>Drawing a sheet of paper to him, he seized a pen, and
wrote rapidly:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“May God forgive you, my beloved mother, for your cruel
pride, and comfort you for the loss of your son; for you have
forced me to choose between you and my heart’s love. You have
put my heart on the rack, like Alva’s; but I am not weak like she
was, my poor sister; so I, loving you still, and praying as ever
for your welfare, renounce everything you choose to withhold
from me, for my love’s sake.”</p></div>

<p>It was signed and posted, the brief letter, and then he
realized the might of his love for Floy, that could reconcile
him to such a renunciation as he had made.</p>

<p>He was no longer the heir of a millionaire, but a disinherited
son, with nothing to live on but an income of
three thousand a year left him by his grandfather. What
then? He and Floy would be poor in gold, but rich in
love. He could bear anything, so that she was not taken
away from him.</p>

<p>Two days passed, and then there came another letter
from New York. It was from Otho Maury&mdash;a smooth,<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
fawning letter, pleading the paragraph he inclosed as an
excuse for writing.</p>

<p>It was the story of poor little Floy’s accident, and
Otho wrote briefly of what had happened to Floy since
Beresford had gone away&mdash;the death of John Banks, and
Floy’s venture as a salesgirl in New York, with the unaccountable
accident that had closed the brief story of her
sweet life; for at the end of the paragraph Otho penciled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>She died the next day.</em> Thinking you had a kindly interest
in the sweet girl is the reason why I have written you,” he added.
“As for myself, I loved her, and had proposed marriage, but she
refused me. I hope that our mutual admiration for the dear girl
may form a bond of sympathy between us.”</p></div>

<p>St. George Beresford could not bear the terrible shock
of this letter, following on the excitement of his mother’s
denunciation.</p>

<p>His senses reeled before it, and he sunk in a heavy
swoon to the floor, where an attendant discovered him
presently and summoned a physician, who found him suffering
from the first symptoms of brain fever.</p>

<p>Days and weeks of severe illness followed; but before
he fell into a delirium he gave strict orders that no news
of his condition should be sent to America.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ALVA’S DISAPPOINTMENT.</span></h2>


<p>The day after the theater party Miss Beresford stood
alone in her beautiful studio in a sunny wing thrown out<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
at the side of the mansion, and gazed meditatively at her
latest work.</p>

<p>She was no mean artist, this queenly heiress, for having
much talent in the beginning, she had improved upon
it by spending several years in Paris under the best masters.
She threw all her soul into her work, and delighted
in every successful effort she made.</p>

<p>Her most ambitious work, and one that had occupied
much time and study, was one that she called “Cupid.”</p>

<p>It represented the beautiful little god of love strolling
through a green wood, and coming suddenly on a party
of lovely youths and maidens dancing on the banks of a
crystal stream.</p>

<p>Cupid, charmed by the pretty sight, instantly determined
to make himself two victims in the merry party.
The picture represented Cupid, the mischievous little god,
drawing his bow to transfix a heart with a piercing arrow.</p>

<p>One can fancy how sweet and arch and happy Cupid
must have appeared at that moment when exercising his
fateful power.</p>

<p>The large canvas was almost finished, and the painting
was spirited and striking. The best judges could have
found little fault in the execution. One more touch and
it would be perfect.</p>

<p>The unfinished part was the face of Cupid.</p>

<p>Alva had despaired of putting on canvas the face of
Cupid as it appeared to her fancy.</p>

<p>Beautiful faces she could find in plenty, but the arch,
radiant smile, the laughing eyes so brightly blue, these
eluded her brush.</p>

<p>“If I could only find a living face like my ideal and
put it on canvas!” she cried, eagerly, over and over to her<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
mother, who at last became almost as anxious over the
subject as Alva herself.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that the lady had told Floy she had
looked at her as at a beautiful picture, for in the young
girl’s enchanting face she had seen the realization of
Alva’s dream.</p>

<p>And the artist, standing before her unfinished work, recalled
her mother’s words of the day before, and cried
out, joyously:</p>

<p>“I must find that lovely girl! She must be my model!”</p>

<p>Hastening to her mother, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“You must come with me this morning to find Cupid!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Alva, but I can not go to-day. I&mdash;I am
not feeling well. Besides, I have just commenced a letter
to your brother.”</p>

<p>Alva did not ask what would be written to her brother;
she could guess only too well by the thorn in her own
heart.</p>

<p>She repressed a bursting sigh of sympathy for St.
George, and said, determinedly:</p>

<p>“Then tell me where to find her, for I am going alone
this very hour.”</p>

<p>“She was a young salesgirl at the handkerchief counter
at Maury &amp; Co.’s. I bought those exquisite cobweb lace
handkerchiefs from her, you know.”</p>

<p>“Her name, mamma?”</p>

<p>“I did not ask it, Alva; but you cannot fail to know
her, for there is no one like her. She is the loveliest salesgirl
in New York, and looks like a princess.”</p>

<p>“Tall or short, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Of medium height, dear, slenderly yet exquisitely
formed, with a face of rarest beauty.”</p>

<p>“It should be a boy’s face, mamma.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“This one is boyish, Alva, because the sunny hair lies
in soft loose rings of short hair all over the pretty head,
and the roguish smile, and the dimples, the sea-shell coloring,
the marvelous eyes so brightly blue, so innocent&mdash;arch&mdash;oh,
I can not describe them!&mdash;go see for yourself.”</p>

<p>“I will; and you may expect me to bring her home
with me.”</p>

<p>She hurried out, ordered the carriage, and within an
hour was on her way to the store.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford turned back with a sigh to her task,
and finished the cruel letter that was to carry such pain
to her son across the sea.</p>

<p>When the bitter task was over she threw herself upon
a low divan and wept bitterly a long, long while, almost
frightened at what she had done.</p>

<p>She feared that she could not mold her son’s will to
compliance by harshness as easily as she had done that
of his timid sister.</p>

<p>“But he will not give up everything&mdash;he could not be
so rash&mdash;for the sake of a fair-faced girl,” she told herself,
with faint flickering hope.</p>

<p>Several hours later Alva entered the room, still in her
rich carriage-dress, her face pale and grave.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma, I have had a great shock,” she sighed.</p>

<p>“You did not find Cupid?”</p>

<p>“No; she had not come to the store this morning, but
they told me where she boarded, and I drove there. Oh,
what a terrible story I heard!”</p>

<p>“The girl had eloped, perhaps,” smiled the lady.</p>

<p>“Worse than that. I’ve often regretted that I didn’t
elope myself when I was a girl,” returned Alva, flippantly;
then instantly grew serious again as she continued,
sadly: “The poor girl, by some strange accident, fell<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
from her window in the fourth story down to the street
last evening, and was removed to Bellevue, unconscious,
and believed to be dying.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how sad, how shocking! and she was <em>so sweet</em>!”
mused Mrs. Beresford, tenderly.</p>

<p>“So I drove to Bellevue, though expecting to find her
dead,” went on Alva. “And now, mamma, comes the
strangest part of the story&mdash;my Cupid had been mysteriously
spirited away from the hospital.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“WHERE IS SHE NOW?”</span></h2>


<p>“Alva!” cried Mrs. Beresford, gazing at her daughter
in consternation.</p>

<p>She grew pale and shuddered as she spoke, for the
thought of the lovely girl’s terrible accident touched her
deeply.</p>

<p>“Is it not a terrible disappointment?” cried Alva.
“Perhaps I shall never find her now, and my ‘Cupid’ will
never be finished.”</p>

<p>“But surely the girl will be found again!” Mrs. Beresford
cried, consolingly; but Alva shook her head.</p>

<p>“I fear not, for her disappearance was so strange. Listen,
mamma: they took her to Bellevue, and she did not
recover consciousness the whole way. They supposed she
would certainly die of her terrible fall. When they arrived
at the hospital, she was left alone on a couch in the
receiving-room for a few minutes, so the attendants say,
and when the physician in charge went to see about her<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
case, the little beauty was gone&mdash;had vanished as entirely
as if she had been snatched up into the sky or swallowed
by the earth, and left not a trace behind.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford smiled, and said:</p>

<p>“But, as we know that neither one of those things happened
to her, we may hope that she is safe. My own
theory is that she was unhurt by the fall, and simply
fainted from the shock. When she recovered from her
swoon, she doubtless became alarmed at finding herself
alone in that strange place, and ran away in a fright.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what they think at the hospital; but what
became of her, mamma, <em>afterward</em>?”</p>

<p>She paused a moment, then added, anxiously:</p>

<p>“You see, that was the day before yesterday, and she
never returned to her boarding-house nor the store. So&mdash;<em>where
is she now?</em>”</p>

<p>And that question, asked by Mrs. Beresford’s pale lips,
became the text on which many changes were rung afterward.</p>

<p>A beautiful young girl had disappeared in the strangest
way, and no clew to the mystery could be found.</p>

<p>The hospital authorities, fearing they might be accused
of neglect in the matter, kept the occurrence as quiet as
possible; and when some rumor of it reached the ubiquitous
reporter, and he came to make inquiries, they told
him the girl was all right&mdash;oh, yes, and had returned to
her friends in New Jersey. She had written back to
say that she had recovered from her swoon and ran away
in a fright, that was all. Might he see the letter? Certainly.</p>

<p>But a hasty search proved unavailing. They were
sorry, very sorry, but it must have gone into the waste-basket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[94]</span></p>

<p>So the reporter, satisfied that there was no sensation
in the case, withdrew, and sought a spicy paragraph for
his paper elsewhere. But, all the same, he had been
cleverly gulled and cheated out of an interesting item.</p>

<p>For the mystery of Florence Fane’s disappearance became
one of the most unfathomable on record.</p>

<p>The fair young girl returned neither to her New York
boarding-house, nor to the store where she was employed,
nor to her Mount Vernon home.</p>

<p>It was not until a week had passed, and poor Mrs.
Banks was beginning to fret over the non-reception of
letters from Floy, that she was told the terrible truth of
the girl’s disappearance.</p>

<p>But, prompted by Otho, they made light of the matter,
declaring that the giddy young girl would turn up
when least expected. No doubt she had gone to stay with
some new friends she had made in New York.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Banks was heart-broken, but she could do
nothing. Poverty tied her hands from making any search
for her darling. She could only pine and endure in
silence.</p>

<p>The Maurys did not see that there was anything to do
but wait for developments.</p>

<p>In all the world there seemed to be no friend to seek
for the missing girl.</p>

<p>And yet, undreamed of by the Maurys, there was a
search going on for Floy.</p>

<p>It seemed like a grim mocking of fate that the Beresfords,
who would have rejoiced to hear of the death of
St. George’s sweetheart, should have put themselves to
great expense to trace Florence Fane in her mysterious
disappearance. Yet they had done so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford was at heart a noble lady, and, where
personal pride did not goad her to extremes, a firm friend.</p>

<p>She had taken a strong, admiring interest in the pretty
young salesgirl whose beauty had charmed her, and whose
pride had amused her while it also inspired respect.</p>

<p>She would not have owned it to herself, but Floy’s blue
eyes had looked straight into her heart and won herself
a place there.</p>

<p>She had conceived the idea of employing the young
girl to act as a model for Alva, and her disappointment
was almost as keen as Alva’s when she learned the truth.</p>

<p>Each day they both felt the disappointment more
keenly, until from the mother came the startling suggestion:</p>

<p>“Why not put a private detective on her track?”</p>

<p>“Mamma, you seem to feel sure that the girl is alive,
while on my side I think that her brain was injured by
her terrible fall, and that she left the hospital in a dazed
condition and met death in her wanderings.”</p>

<p>“I have a strange feeling that the girl is alive and will
be found again, dear, so I shall put a detective on the
case at once,” returned Mrs. Beresford; and she sent for
one in whom she knew she could place confidence, and
sent him on the quest.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“OH, MY SON, MY SON!”</span></h2>


<p>The clever detective was not the only person who was
furtively engaged in an eager search for the missing girl.</p>

<p>Otho Maury, although he had written falsely to St.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
George Beresford that Floy was dead, had learned already,
to his dismay, of her strange disappearance.</p>

<p>He saw that matters were more complicated than ever.</p>

<p>Floy was alive, he felt sure, and he foreboded that she
would be turning up at some inopportune moment in
Maybelle’s path, and blocking her way to success with
Beresford.</p>

<p>He guessed readily enough that Floy had become
frightened at his persecutions, and had hidden herself
away from him, awaiting Beresford’s return.</p>

<p>And at the bare thought of Beresford’s possessing the
enchanting little beauty, Otho’s jealous blood leaped like
fire along his veins, and he swore to himself that he would
rather murder Floy with his own hands than to witness
her happiness with his splendid, noble rival.</p>

<p>Again he held a secret conference with his sister, and
she raged with anger when she learned of Floy’s escape
from death.</p>

<p>“You have botched everything, and I shall lose the
man I love, after all!” she cried, stormily; and her
brother, unmoved by her blame, replied, coldly:</p>

<p>“Your chances certainly do not appear good at present;
but I will continue to do the best I can for your interests.
But the game is in fate’s hands, and will be hard won, if
won at all.”</p>

<p>“If you could only find her and put her out of the way,”
she muttered, darkly.</p>

<p>“I will try,” he answered; and it was tacitly understood
between them that the contest against Floy’s life
and honor was to be waged more persistently than ever.</p>

<p>Let her but be found again, and Otho swore that he
would make it impossible for her to marry Beresford.</p>

<p>Oh, it was cruel, shameful, wicked, this terrible warfare<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
against a helpless orphan girl to whom life might
otherwise have proved so bright and fair!</p>

<p>It was a wonder that peaceful sleep could visit the pillows
of the two arch-plotters, Otho and Maybelle.</p>

<p>Yet the girl dreamed of a future wherein Floy should
be swept from her path and Beresford won at last, while
Otho&mdash;well, as for Otho, the future did not look so bright.</p>

<p>He loved Floy, and the plot against her, though he
never swerved from it, planted thorns in his own heart.</p>

<p>So he took up the quest for the hapless little beauty,
and when all inquiry failed in New York and Mount
Vernon, he was obliged to consider himself baffled.</p>

<p>“I wish I had the powers of an amateur detective,” he
thought, longingly; but he did not dare to employ one.</p>

<p>And he would have been startled if he had known that
he was under the espionage of the best private detective
in New York.</p>

<p>For Mrs. Beresford’s clever employé in pursuing his
search for Floy, had informed himself first of all as to
whether the young girl had a lover.</p>

<p>He found out that Otho Maury had paid her marked
attention, and while he pursued his search for Floy
he kept a careful eye on her lover.</p>

<p>And his first suspicion that Otho might know the girl’s
whereabouts was soon dissipated by finding out that
Otho was as keenly on the alert as himself.</p>

<p>So the mystery deepened.</p>

<p>Neither lover nor detective could find one trace of
bonny Floy after her flight from Bellevue that fateful
twenty-first of May.</p>

<p>The detective went down to Mount Vernon and spent
a week. He found out everything about the girl, save
<a id="Ref_97"></a>and except that St. George Beresford had been her accepted<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
lover. That affair had been so brief that none
guessed it save Otho and Maybelle.</p>

<p>Floyd Landon, the detective, intercepted Mrs. Banks
in one of her visits to the cemetery, and in a casual way,
introduced himself, hoping to find out something more.
She was quite willing to talk on the beloved subject; but
she could tell no more than the neighbors had told already&mdash;the
story of Suicide Place, and the pretty child the
kind carpenter had taken from her dead mother’s arms
and brought to their humble cottage to be their own
thereafter.</p>

<p>“And,” sobbed the broken-hearted widow, looking
down with streaming eyes at the lonely grave, “we loved
her just as dearly as if she had been our own flesh and
blood, and if my poor John knew what she has come to
now, I don’t believe he could rest in his grave.”</p>

<p>“It was very noble in you both to care for her as you
did,” said Floyd Landon; and a minute later he asked,
thoughtfully: “In case of her being proved dead, who
will inherit Suicide Place?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, sir&mdash;there are no relatives alive that
I’m aware of. It seemed like Floy was the last of her
line.”</p>

<p>“And you do not believe that she has followed the example
of her race and cut herself off from life?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Banks shuddered.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, I can not believe that she would do that.
She always laughed at the notion, and never showed any
superstition but once.”</p>

<p>His persuasive gaze coaxed her to proceed with her
confidences.</p>

<p>“It was the night before she went away to be a salesgirl<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
in the great city,” continued Mrs. Banks. “We sat
up late talking, and sweet little Floy said, humbly:</p>

<p>“‘There’s one thing I must confess to you, auntie:
I’ve often disobeyed your orders and gone into Suicide
Place alone. Will you forgive me now?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh my dear, how could you venture near that terrible
place?’ I cried, in alarm. Then, seeing the paleness
of her sweet face, I added: ‘I forgive you, dear; but
you must never venture near that place again.’</p>

<p>“‘No, I <em>never</em> shall!’ cried Floy, with the greatest
energy. Clasping her pretty little hands together, she
went on, tremblingly: ‘I went there once too often,
auntie, dear, and I found out the&mdash;the&mdash;I found out that
the old place is haunted, as people say, and I think I understand
the malign influence there that drives people to
madness and suicide.’</p>

<p>“I begged her to tell me all, but she refused, growing
pale, and trembling like a leaf in a storm, as she added:</p>

<p>“‘I must not tell any one. It is an accursed knowledge,
and brings doom on those who learn it&mdash;a terrible
doom! Oh, I used to laugh at the croakers, but now I
know they were right. I have seen the horror that haunts
the place. I know the secret hidden in those old stone
walls. But it shall not destroy me, auntie, dear, for I
will shun it like the plague. Never will I cross that fatal
threshold again; and if I am ever rich enough, I shall
have the house torn down stone by stone, and let in the
light of day on the earth it covers, so that there shall be
no more curse upon it!’”</p>

<p>“And she would tell you no more, madame?”</p>

<p>“Not one word more; and the next day she went away
from me, my pretty darling, to be lost in the mysteries of
that wicked New York!” sobbed the poor woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>“Do you really believe that Suicide Place is haunted,
Madame?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, certainly. Every one says so; and lights
have been seen in the windows many a dark night, though
the place hasn’t had a tenant these nine years and more.
’Tis said that evil spirits haunt the place and drive the
tenants to madness or suicide.”</p>

<p>Her story was interesting, but it threw no light on the
deep mystery of Florence Fane’s fate.</p>

<p>So he went back to New York to tell his wealthy patron
that he had failed in his quest.</p>

<p>“I have learned all that was possible to find out about
her,” he said. “It is agreed by all who know her that
she was lovely and fascinating to a high degree. She
had many admirers, but she had laughed at them in her
pretty, saucy fashion, and all believed that she was heart-whole
and fancy-free.”</p>

<p>He found Mrs. Beresford and Alva so strangely interested
in the young girl’s fate that he told them all he had
heard at Mount Vernon of her romantic story, and
added:</p>

<p>“It seems likely that there is a stain of madness in
the blood leading ultimately to suicide. This young girl,
inheriting this terrible taint, and suffering an aberration
of mind from her fall, may have fled from the hospital
straight to the cold embrace of the river.”</p>

<p>They shuddered, the two beautiful, high-born women,
at his words, but Mrs. Beresford said quickly:</p>

<p>“Although it is a plausible theory, there is one weak
point in it.”</p>

<p>Landon looked at her inquiringly, and she said:</p>

<p>“If a strain of madness in the race led its members to
suicide, why did one who was alien to them&mdash;a hired man<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
on the place, I think you said&mdash;prove the victim in one
decade?”</p>

<p>“That fact escaped my mind while I was speaking,”
he replied, “so my theory really has no ground to stand
on. The horror-haunted house must really have some
malign influence, must be haunted, as the young girl
averred.”</p>

<p>“It is a strange story you have told us, Mr. Landon,
and makes the young girl more interesting to us than
before. I hope you will not entirely give up the search,
for success would be liberally rewarded,” said Mrs.
Beresford, as she handed him a munificent check for his
two weeks’ services.</p>

<p>He bowed himself out, and then the mask of conventionality
fell from the proud woman’s face, and it grew
sad to the verge of tears.</p>

<p>“Oh, my son, my son!” she sobbed under her breath,
and the thought of him was like a sword in her wounded
heart.</p>

<p>She had that day received from St. George the sorrowful
letter in which he had renounced home and wealth for
Love’s sake.</p>

<p>Bitter was her anger, deep the wound in her heart, as
she read the brief, manly words.</p>

<p>“He is stubborn, foolish!” she cried, as she flung
the letter to Alva.</p>

<p>Her queenly daughter read it, and smiled her light,
cynical smile.</p>

<p>“How brave he is, how loyal to his love! I see now
that he was in earnest, and I admire him more than
ever!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Alva!” reproachfully.</p>

<p>“I mean it all, mamma! I&mdash;I would not have my<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
brother’s heart tortured as mine was in my spring of
youth.”</p>

<p>“Have we not humored every other whim, my darling?”</p>

<p>“You have been most indulgent, but&mdash;&mdash;” and Alva
broke off with a long, quivering sigh.</p>

<p>She was thinking:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indentquote0">“Thou canst not restore me the depth and the truth

</div><div class="indent0">And sad and faint-hearted I wander alone.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>“His father will be bitterly angry,” said Mrs. Beresford,
sighing.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” Alva returned, indifferently.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you take sides with your brother against
us,” stiffly.</p>

<p>Alva laughed drearily, then said, coldly:</p>

<p>“I glory in his independence!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“YOU WICKED, WICKED GIRL!” CRIED THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR.</span></h2>


<p>Otho Maury received no answer to the letter he
so artfully sent to St. George Beresford.</p>

<p>But he had not expected a reply. He knew that the
blow must fall with too crushing a weight on the lover’s
heart to admit of comment, and he knew also that Beresford<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
would never forgive him for his offense against
Floy.</p>

<p>He gave up the quest for the missing girl after two
weeks, and went back to Mount Vernon distracted with
doubt and fear.</p>

<p>“I am all at sea,” he confessed, frankly, to Maybelle,
who grew pale with anger as she cried:</p>

<p>“You have failed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have failed. There is no clew to her disappearance.
She may possibly be dead, but the probabilities
are that, frightened by my persecution, she has hidden
herself away from all who know her to baffle persecution
until Beresford’s return. Let us hope that she
is dead.”</p>

<p>“She is not dead. She will live to thwart all our
hopes!” cried his sister, furiously.</p>

<p>Springing to her feet, she stood before him, livid with
emotion, hissing:</p>

<p>“Oh, how I hate that girl! I wish that I had killed
her last night when I had her in my power!”</p>

<p>“Last night, Maybelle! Why, what do you mean?”
he exclaimed in wonder, clutching her arm and forcing
her back to a seat.</p>

<p>Maybelle leaned back panting and unnerved for a moment,
then cried, bitterly:</p>

<p>“I was a fool to be frightened and take her for a
ghost!”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Maybelle, and tell me what you
mean,” Otho insisted, excitedly.</p>

<p>Fixing her flashing eyes on his face, she said, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Do you know that all the talk for several days has
been that Floy’s ghost has been seen several times in
Mount Vernon in the past two weeks?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[104]</span></p>

<p>“No&mdash;no.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is true, Otho. She has been seen three times,
they say, by towns-people, twice on foot, and one night
on her bicycle. But when spoken to, she did not reply,
and vanished like a spirit. So they say that she is surely
dead.”</p>

<p>He started, and his eyes flashed as he cried:</p>

<p>“But you, Maybelle?&mdash;you said you saw her last night!
Where?”</p>

<p>“Here, Otho, in this very house!”</p>

<p>“Heavens! then she must be in collusion with Mrs.
Banks.”</p>

<p>“No, she is not. The woman firmly believes that her
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i> is dead.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me all. Do you not see how impatient you
have made me with your mysterious hints?”</p>

<p>She leaned nearer to him and whispered, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“She was here in this house at midnight last night.
I was lying asleep on my bed. The windows were raised,
for the air was oppressively warm. Then, too, I liked to
smell the mingled odors of rose and honeysuckle clambering
up the trellis. It was clear, bright moonlight, so I extinguished
my lamp when I retired.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; go on, Maybelle!” breathed Otho, impatiently.</p>

<p>“I fell asleep, and rested calmly until about midnight,
when I awakened in a fright, for some one was shaking
me rudely.</p>

<p>“‘Get up&mdash;get up, Maybelle Maury! I want the letters
my lover wrote me&mdash;the letters you have stolen!’
cried an angry voice.</p>

<p>“I started bolt upright in bed, frightened almost to
death, and half-dazed by being so suddenly roused from<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
sleep, and there before me was that little vixen Floy,
all in ghastly white, her golden hair all in a fluff over her
head like a halo. She stood in a patch of white moonlight
that made her look ethereal, and in my confusion I really
took her for a ghost!”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Otho, impatiently; and Maybelle
said, deprecatingly:</p>

<p>“You must remember that I was roused from sleep
and taken by surprise, or I should not have been so
easily deceived. And she was so imperative, she did not
give me time to collect my thoughts, but went on, angrily:</p>

<p>“‘Get up, Maybelle Maury, you wicked, wicked girl,
and give me my letters this minute, or I will go to your
Mother and tell her how cruelly you and Otho have
treated me! You will not enjoy that, for your mother
is a good woman; she would be shocked if she knew that
you told the postman a lie that you might get my letters
and keep them from me.’”</p>

<p>“She did not talk much like a ghost,” interpolated
Otho.</p>

<p>“No, she did not, but I was so dazed and frightened
I did not realize it then. And the little vixen kept scolding
and threatening and pointing her finger at me until
I felt like one under a hypnotic spell, and afraid to disobey;
so, following the pointing of her finger, I rose
from my bed, staggered tremblingly to my desk, and
handed her the package of letters I had intercepted.
Then, overcome by horror, I fell unconscious upon the
bed. When I revived, my midnight visitor had disappeared.”</p>

<p>“It was Floy herself!” declared Otho, with bitter
chagrin.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am certain of it&mdash;have not doubted it since<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
I came to my sober senses,” answered Maybelle, with
a choking sigh of futile rage. “Oh, how I hate myself,”
she continued, “for giving her those letters! She is
gloating over them&mdash;rejoicing at every tender word&mdash;while
I&mdash;I could strangle her with my own hands for her
triumph over me!”</p>

<p>“And I!” cried Otho, burning with murderous jealousy
at thought of Floy’s innocent joy at the recovery
of her love letters.</p>

<p>He could fancy what tender words Beresford would
write to his darling, and how her eyes would beam with
joy as she read them over.</p>

<p>He felt, like Maybelle, that he would like to strangle
the joy in her sweet white throat with murderous hands.</p>

<p>“I am sorry now that I did not follow my first impulse
and burn those hateful letters!” cried Maybelle
regretfully.</p>

<p>“How many were there?” asked her brother, grimly.</p>

<p>“Seven in all. He must have written to her every day
until he received your letter that she was dead. And
such letters! fully of the silliest love. Pah!” cried the
girl, who despised the letters because they were written
to her rival.</p>

<p>If they had been intended for her&mdash;jealous, envious
Maybelle&mdash;she would have wished them framed in gold
and precious stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>For what is so dear to a woman’s heart as a love letter
from the man she adores?</p>

<p>The mere sight of it makes the blood bound gladly
through her frame, and brightens eye and cheek with
joy.</p>

<p>The touch of it makes her fingers tingle with delight.</p>

<p>She reads it over and over in the solitude of her own
chamber, and kisses it as fondly as if it were the face
of her beloved.</p>

<p>She carries it in her bosom by day, and places it beneath
her pillow, to bring blissful dreams, by night.</p>

<p>All this bliss of which Maybelle had robbed bonny
Floy was hers now, and the angry girl’s bosom throbbed
with the awful pain of jealousy as she realized how her
sweet rival would rejoice over those ardent words of love
sprinkled like diamonds over the pages he had written
for her comfort while they were sundered one from each
other.</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Otho listened to his sister with a cynical frown, guessing
all that she suffered by the pain in his own heart.</p>

<p>“I have a suspicion!” he exclaimed, abruptly.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>“Floy is hidden at Suicide Place,” he said, with an evil
gleam in his deep-set, dark eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you think so? But Floy told Mrs. Banks before
she went away that she had seen something terrible there,
and would never cross the threshold again.”</p>

<p>“No matter; I believe she is in hiding there. It is so
simple a solution of the mystery that I wonder it did
not occur to me before. Yes, she is surely at Suicide
Place, and I shall entrap her to-night!” he exclaimed,
with triumphant malice.</p>

<p>“But, Otho, are you not afraid to venture into that
fatal house?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least. I prize my life too highly ever to
commit suicide, I assure you. I am strong-minded, practical.
The grim influence of the place will not affect
me.”</p>

<p>“I am glad that you think so, and I hope that you
prosper in your undertaking to-night.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sis, I can not foresee any possible failure
this time. She will be entirely at my mercy, with no
Beresford to interfere.”</p>

<p>They were both silent for a time, ashamed to discuss
their wicked plans, then Maybelle drew a deep breath,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Whatever is done it must be ended soon, for it is
three weeks now since he sailed, and he expected to return
in a month.”</p>

<p>“Her fate will be sealed before then,” Otho answered,
quickly, and added: “If you are ever to win Beresford,
it must be done quickly also, for father is on the verge
of failure, though reputed a millionaire.”</p>

<p>“On the verge of failure&mdash;oh, heavens! That is why
he refused me the new set of diamonds I craved! Oh,<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
Heaven help me to win Beresford, for I could not endure
a life of poverty!” exclaimed Maybelle, hysterically.</p>

<p>“I do not see how I am to endure it either; but I did
not seem to make any progress with the heiress,” grumbled
Otho.</p>

<p>“You did not, for she showed her indifference too
plainly to encourage the least hope,” agreed his sister,
frankly.</p>

<p>“Curse her for a proud, haughty jade; but I do not
care for her any way. My heart is set on bewitching
little Fly-away Floy.”</p>

<p>“Then why not marry her, Otho, if you care so much,
since that would take her from Beresford as effectually
as if she were dead?”</p>

<p>“She would not marry me to save my life, the proud
little minx! But I’ll have my revenge for her scorn,
never fear, and leave the field clear for you to win
Beresford,” laughed Otho, gratingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you succeed, I shall pay you well out of my
husband’s riches,” she cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>“You may not get the handling of many dollars, and
my demands will be exhorbitant,” he grumbled, sighing:
“I wish that the foul fiend would deign to show
me some royal road to fortune.”</p>

<p>It was an aspiration he had uttered often before in
his greed for gold and his impatience of his father’s
restraints, and no thought came to him that it would
be granted soon.</p>

<p>Rejoicing in his good luck at finding Floy’s hiding-place
at last, he waited most impatiently for the close of
the beautiful June day that he might sally forth on his
dastardly errand.</p>

<p>The sun set in a blaze of golden glory, and the young<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
moon rose over the tree-tops, shedding a tender amber
light upon the quiet, resting world.</p>

<p>As soon as he could get away unobserved, Otho took
the lonely road toward Suicide Place.</p>

<p>“She cannot escape me now, my pretty Floy!” he
muttered.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">HOW THOSE TENDER LETTERS TO ANOTHER MUST HAVE STABBED MAYBELLE’S HEART!</span></h2>


<p>“Oh, my darling, a whole life-time of devotion shall
teach you the strength of my love. Your life with me,
my bonny bride, shall be a dream of bliss.”</p>

<p>Floy’s big, starry-blue eyes glowed like blue jewels in
the dusk as she read aloud the tender words of her
lover’s letter.</p>

<p>Then she pressed her rosy lips to the page as fondly
as though it had been the handsome face of her absent
love.</p>

<p>“How he loves me, my noble, splendid, beautiful,
dark-eyed lover! He has chosen me, simple little Floy,
poor and obscure, out of a whole world of rich and
beautiful girls, any one of whom must have loved him
if he had so chosen,” she cried in an ecstasy of adoring
love.</p>

<p>She was alone in a large, gloomy bedroom of Suicide
Place, for, as Otho had suspected, on hearing Maybelle’s
story to-day, she was here in hiding from her
<a id="Ref_110"></a>foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>She had been most indiscreet in her adventure last
night, but the longing to possess the letters Beresford
had written to her overpowered every other impulse; so,
trusting that Maybelle might take <em>her</em> for a ghost, the
brave little beauty made a determined onslaught and
secured her own property, escaping undetected through
the open window that looked upon an upper veranda
wreathed in fragrant vines.</p>

<p>“What a wretch she was to obtain my letters in that
fashion! I am glad I thought of going to see the good
carrier and finding out the truth, or I never should
have had these sweet words to read!” cried Floy, kissing
them again, as she had done dozens of times already to-day.</p>

<p>In the falling twilight she sat at the upper window behind
the lace curtain that screened her from view outside,
and read and reread the precious trophies in artless
delight, her heart throbbing fast with joy at each tender
word.</p>

<p>“What a fortunate girl I am to have won such a splendid
lover!” she thought, with innocent pride and exultation,
for her tender young heart yearned for love and
care, she was so lonely.</p>

<p>Floy did not realize all her great charms of mind and
person, and in her lack of vanity she was always wondering
how the splendid Beresford had chosen her so
quickly for his heart’s queen out of a whole world full
lovely girls.</p>

<p>“Oh, what lovely words and thoughts!” cried Floy,
reading them again for the twentieth time; and she added,
half in pity for cruel, jealous Maybelle: “How it must
have stabbed her heart to read these tender words addressed
to me! It must have been punishment enough
for all her sin.”</p>

<p>She was right; for what could be more cruel pain to a
jealous, envious heart than to read those words of love
to another?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div></div>

<p>The purple gloaming deepened, the shadows grew
darker in the gloomy room, until even the eyes of love
could not distinguish the written words; so Floy laid
her letters upon the little table before her, and fell to
dreaming over them in tender wise:</p>

<p>“<em>Seven</em> letters! and such beautiful <em>long</em> ones, too! Oh,
how good he was to write me such charming love letters!
Can such love ever grow cold, I wonder? Can he
ever look back and regret? Ah, no, no, no! I will not
remember the stories of false love I have read and heard.
He, my own dark-eyed lover, is not one of those fickle
wretches flying from one love to another, like a butterfly
from flower to flower. He will be true.”</p>

<p>A happy sigh escaped her lips, and she continued:</p>

<p>“It is terrible being shut up here like a prisoner, with
nothing to eat but half-ripe fruit picked from the orchard
by night! I wish I dared reveal myself to Auntie Banks
and beg her to come here and share my solitude. But
she wouldn’t consent, I know; and those wretches would
contrive some new peril for me, if they found out I
was alive. Oh, dear Heaven, give me patience to bear
this life till my lover returns! It is only a few days
more now, for he said he should not stay longer than
a month. He will think it strange I did not answer his
letters, as he told me to do in each loving postscript; but
I can easily explain all to him when I see him, and he will
not blame me for not writing when he knows I did not
get his letters for so long.”</p>

<p>Poor Floy, counting the days and hours before her<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
lover’s return, how little she dreamed that far across the
sea he lay ill unto death, stricken down by the false and
cruel story that she was dead.</p>

<p>The hours waned, and the moon rose in the purple
sky, while she lingered there, poor child, so lonely in her
exile, so beautiful, so unfortunate.</p>

<p>She rose presently, drew the shutters close, then lighted
a little lamp on the table, not caring much if the light
was seen by passers-by, for she knew no one would
venture in. She had heard stories often of lights being
seen in the house by night, but they were all attributed
to ghostly visitants.</p>

<p>Floy knew the ghastly secret of Suicide Place now, and
nothing but her terror of Otho Maury would have
tempted her to enter the house again.</p>

<p>But when she had recovered consciousness at Bellevue
Hospital the evening of her accident, and found
herself uninjured, an awful fear of Otho Maury’s persecutions
entered her mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could hide myself away from him somewhere
until St. George’s return,” she moaned.</p>

<p>She had a subtle presentiment that Otho’s persecutions
would ruin her life if his nefarious plans were not balked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I must hide myself from that black-hearted
wretch!” she sobbed, sitting up on the couch, and gazing
wildly around.</p>

<p>She saw that she was quite alone, the attendant having
gone to hasten the physician whose duty it was to attend
to her case.</p>

<p>The thought of Suicide Place came to her like an inspiration,
and she sighed to herself that all its horrors
were not equal to Otho Maury’s relentless pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>She staggered to her feet and found herself unhurt.
The long swoon had been the result of the shock of fear.</p>

<p>Pursued by fear and unrest, Floy fled wildly from
the hospital, and as she had on her person the five dollars
given her by Mrs. Banks, she made use of it to return
to Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>That night she rested in the haunted house, that, with
its evil repute, seemed to offer her a refuge from despair.</p>

<p>Here, during the two weeks while the search for her
went on, Floy rested safe from pursuit.</p>

<p>But her adventurous spirit drove her forth at last to inquire
of the letter-carrier about the mail she had expected
to receive from Beresford. Without acquainting him
with her hiding-place, she pledged him to secrecy over
her visit, and obtained from him the information that
Miss Maury had intercepted her letters.</p>

<p>She made several futile trips to the Maury residence
before she succeeded in getting possession of the precious
letters.</p>

<p>Having purposely made herself look as phantom-like
as possible, she was seen by several persons, and the
report that her spirit walked became noised about.</p>

<p>Having obtained the letters, she resolved not to venture
forth again, lest she should be followed and her
identity discovered.</p>

<p>But, as we have seen, by Maybelle’s story, her discretion
came too late, and she was fated to a severe ordeal&mdash;the
result of last night’s adventure.</p>

<p>Through the fragrant gloom of the summer night Otho
Maury was gliding toward the house, wriggling his lean
body through the shadows like a hungry panther about
to spring upon its prey, and as his stealthy step pressed<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
the threshold, he kept muttering, darkly, with horrible
exultation:</p>

<p>“She can not escape me now!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“I WILL SELL MY LIFE AND HONOR DEARLY!” CRIED THE MADDENED GIRL.</span></h2>


<p>The room where Floy sat had been her mother’s bedchamber.
It was a large, handsome apartment, with stenciled
walls and deep mahogany wainscoting after the old
style, and the dark, massive furniture was of the richest
mahogany. The dark polished floor was covered with
rich rugs from Persia, and a magnificent full-length
mirror between the two windows had reflected many a
beautiful face and form of Floy’s ancestors.</p>

<p>They had been handsome people, the Nellests, but
Floy’s beauty was of quite a different type.</p>

<p>Her mother had been dark and stately, like all the
Nellests, but Floy was fair as Venus fresh risen from
the foam. She had inherited her blonde beauty from
her English father, as also her sunny, happy nature. The
Nellests had been cold, grave, severe people, given to
moroseness on account of their loss of fortune sixty
years ago.</p>

<p>They had been rich and grand in their day, and the
first suicide in the family dated from the time when the
death of the head of the house revealed the appalling
fact that the family was beggared, nothing remaining of
vast wealth but the fine farm&mdash;their summer residence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>It was incredible, for old Jasper Nellest had been
miserly in his way, and it was supposed that under his
management the property must have increased instead
of dwindling.</p>

<p>His two sons, both married and fathers of families, investigated
matters, and found that their father had turned
everything he possessed&mdash;bonds, houses, land, and ships
upon the sea&mdash;into hard, yellow, shining gold.</p>

<p>What had become of this great treasure?</p>

<p>They found out that he had also been a heavy and
reckless stock gambler, and this seemed to account for
everything.</p>

<p>The mad thirst for speculation had swallowed up
everything. Having staked all and lost, he died without
confessing that he had beggared his family.</p>

<p>But, as his death had been a swift and sudden one,
from apoplexy, there had been no time for death-bed
disclosures.</p>

<p>But neither did Jasper Nellest leave any papers bearing
on the subject of his lost wealth.</p>

<p>He had simply possessed it, and made “ducks and
drakes” of it. That was the situation that stared his
descendants in the face.</p>

<p>The brothers began an unequal struggle with the world
as poor men with dependent families.</p>

<p>The elder one suicided within a decade, and the younger
dragged the weary chain of life until he was sixty; then
death released him.</p>

<p>But along the path of their descendants each decade
was marked by a suicide in the morose family, and they
decreased in numbers until the unfortunate line had almost
died out. Only Floy was left now&mdash;fairest and
most unfortunate of her race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>The shadows of fate had indeed fallen most heavily
on that little golden head.</p>

<p>Bereaved of all who loved her, bound in the cruel toils
of poverty, sundered from her lover, in hiding from relentless
foes&mdash;alas, poor little Floy!</p>

<p>Floy paced up and down the room awhile, yawned
and threw herself down again in a chair at the window.</p>

<p>“How slowly the time goes!” she sighed. “I wish
I <em>did</em> have a lock to that door! But I don’t suppose anything
human will annoy me here. Otho Maury <em>would</em>,
I know, if he dreamed that I was here; but, of course, he
is searching for me in New York, hoping all the while
that I’m dead and out of Maybelle’s way. Oh-h-h! what
was <em>that</em>?”</p>

<p>She shuddered and groaned, for a sound had reached
her ears in the awfully still old house&mdash;an eerie sound!</p>

<p>It came up from the parlor below, and sounded like a
discord played by unskilled hands upon the piano keys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>It had been caused, in fact, by Otho Maury, stumbling
against the piano, in his furtive search for Floy.</p>

<p>Floy’s heart thumped terrifically against her side for
a moment, then she recovered herself as memory recalled
her first night at Suicide Place.</p>

<p>“It’s just the mice running over the piano keys,” she
laughed.</p>

<p>A full half an hour passed, and she grew nervous and
restless, startled by muffled sounds of footsteps in the
house.</p>

<p>“What can it be?&mdash;the wind or the rats?” she muttered,
in alarm. “I have never heard such strange noises
in the house before. Can any one have dared enter?”</p>

<p>Instinctively she caught up a dagger that she had found
in a drawer of the old-fashioned bureau and laid on the
table for self-protection.</p>

<p>Drawing the keen, shining blade from its sheath, she
held it in her hand, her flashing eyes turned toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Let any intruder dare enter here, and I will sell my
life and honor dearly!” she cried.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">AT BAY.</span></h2>


<p>As if in answer to her defiance, a stealthy hand turned
the knob, the door swung lightly back, and the form of
a man stood hesitating on the threshold.</p>

<p>“Otho Maury!”</p>

<p>The cry shrilled over her lips in a strangled gasp of<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
loathing&mdash;not fear, for with that weapon in her hand she
felt strong to defy the villain.</p>

<p>He started, and stood looking at her with dazed eyes.</p>

<p>He had searched the whole house over by the aid of a
dark lantern, and almost began to despair of success,
when he opened this last door.</p>

<p>He found her there, beautiful, brave, defiant, her angry
blue eyes fixed on him, and her white hand grasping the
weapon whose shining blade would surely be sheathed
in his heart if he dared approach the little beauty.</p>

<p>After his first start of surprise he cried, longingly:</p>

<p>“Floy!”</p>

<p>She saw that he was deathly pale, and heard a strange
tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>“He is frightened, and I shall easily drive him off,”
she thought, exultantly; and replied:</p>

<p>“How dare you intrude yourself into this house again,
Otho Maury? Have you forgotten how you were punished
the last time?”</p>

<p>He glared angrily at her, and returned:</p>

<p>“No; but Beresford is not here to save you now.”</p>

<p>“But I can defend myself!” she cried, defiantly,
brandishing her weapon.</p>

<p>“Put down that child’s toy, my dear. I am not afraid
of it in the least. I could take it from you and snap it
like a twig!”</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> afraid, you wretch! Your face is ashen
pale and your voice trembles with fear!” she retorted,
confidently.</p>

<p>“If my face is pale, and my voice weak, it is not from
fear of that shining little blade in your tiny hand, it is
from horror at what I have seen since I entered this<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>
house. Tell me, Floy, did you know that this house is
really haunted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I knew it,” she answered, and her voice grew
tremulous also, while a look of horror dawned in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“You knew it!” he cried in wonder. “Then how have
you had the courage to remain here alone?”</p>

<p>“You do well to ask that question,” the poor girl cried
out, bitterly. “You, Otho Maury, who have almost
hounded me to death. Stay! do not advance one step
nearer, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He drew back sullenly, and remained on the threshold
facing her with his back to the dark corridor, while he
said, pleadingly:</p>

<p>“Floy, I followed you here with an honorable object.
I love you madly. Will you become my wife?”</p>

<p>“Never!” she answered, curtly, with measureless contempt
that angered him to frenzy.</p>

<p>“Take care how you scorn me, pretty Floy, for you
are in my power, and I may take a terrible revenge for
your contempt,” he exclaimed, advancing toward her,
secure in his ability to disarm the weak, puny girl.</p>

<p>“Heaven help me!” silently prayed the poor girl, bracing
herself to drive home her weapon of defense into her
assailant’s breast as soon as he came within reach.</p>

<p>“If you come within reach, you are rushing on your
death!” she cried, wildly.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” he laughed, as at some pretty child, and
made a rush sidewise, aiming to wrench away the weapon,
and, in spite of her alertness, he grasped the middle of
the arm that held the dagger.</p>

<p>Like a flash, Floy transferred it to her other hand and
struck out at random.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>But the keen blade went home, piercing the side of
his neck through, and as the blood spurted into his face,
blinding him with its hot waves, he relaxed his hold and
fell dizzily to the floor.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ANOTHER INTRUDER.</span></h2>


<p>Still grasping the bloody weapon, Floy looked down in
terror at the body of her bleeding victim.</p>

<p>“Oh-h-h! I have killed the mean coward, but&mdash;I
couldn’t help it&mdash;I had to do it!” she exclaimed, bursting
into hysterical sobs.</p>

<p>“Bravo, miss, that was a brave deed! He deserved
death; but if you had waited a minute longer, I would
have killed him for you myself!” exclaimed an admiring
voice, and a man who had been watching and listening in
the corridor outside came hastily into the room.</p>

<p>He was a stranger to Floy, but you and I, reader, know
him as the clever detective who had been searching for
our heroine for several weeks.</p>

<p>Once he had decided that he would give up the hopeless
quest, but his patron’s anxiety spurred him on to another
effort.</p>

<p>He returned to Mount Vernon, and when he heard
the story of Floy’s spirit having been seen abroad on several
nights, he conceived a suspicion that the missing girl
might be hidden at Suicide Place, in spite of her assertion
that she would never venture near the house again.</p>

<p>Having no fear of ghosts, and laughing to himself at<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
the idea of the place being haunted, he determined to
search it for Floy.</p>

<p>He went upon the quest the same evening that Otho
did, and arriving some time later, went carefully round
the house till he saw some gleams of light shining through
the shutters.</p>

<p>“She is there!” he thought, exultantly, and went in
through a door that Otho had carelessly left open.</p>

<p>Without taking the trouble to explore the lower regions,
he made his way to the second story, following the
location of the light he had detected.</p>

<p>When his stealthy steps reached the upper corridor he
saw, to his amazement, a man stealing along in front of
him, guided by a dark lantern.</p>

<p>The next moment he recognized him as Otho Maury,
whose steps he had once dogged in the hope of discovering
Floy.</p>

<p>“Aha! I was right after all; he <em>is</em> her lover. I will
watch and see what comes of this!” he cried to himself,
keeping at a safe distance behind Otho.</p>

<p>By this means he became an excited spectator of the
tragic scene that followed, and learned how deeply Floy
feared and dreaded her villainous persecutor.</p>

<p>He was springing into the room to her assistance,
when the frantic thrust of her little dagger struck Maury
at random in the neck, and stretched him bleeding at her
feet.</p>

<p>At her sobs of terror and remorse&mdash;for it was awful to
the gentle, white-souled girl to realize that she had taken
life, even in self-defense&mdash;he cried, cheerily:</p>

<p>“Bravo, miss! that was a brave deed. He deserved
death; but if you had waited a minute longer, I would
have killed him for you myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>Floy shrunk against the window, with a low cry of
alarm, as she beheld this new intruder.</p>

<p>“Oh, God, why am I so bitterly persecuted?”</p>

<p>“I beg you not to be afraid of me, Miss Fane. I am
your friend,” exclaimed the detective, kindly.</p>

<p>His voice sounded so honest and kindly that Floy said,
faintly:</p>

<p>“Who are you? How came you here, sir?”</p>

<p>“I am Floyd Landon, a detective, miss; and I came
here to search for you, but not with any evil intent, be
sure; for I was employed by a true friend of yours, who
will be delighted when I take you to her house.”</p>

<p>Floy summoned courage to look at him, and saw that
he was a good-looking, middle-aged person, with the
frank, open face an honest countryman. No one
would have suspected that he was one of the most successful
detectives in the city of New York.</p>

<p>His heart was as kind as his face, too, and it was
touched by the misery of the girl who was so remorseful
over having destroyed a life.</p>

<p>Her beauty astonished him also, even though Mrs.
Beresford’s flattering description had prepared him in
some measure for Floy’s charms.</p>

<p>“A friend of mine!” she cried, in surprise. “Oh
then it must have been Mrs. Banks. I think she is the
only true friend I have in the world.”</p>

<p>“No, it is not Mrs. Banks; it is another woman in the
great city of New York.”</p>

<p>“Not Mrs. Horton; she is no friend of mine!” cried
Floy, who suspected the woman of having sent Otho
Maury to her room that evening.</p>

<p>“Not Mrs. Horton,” he replied, and bent down to look
at Otho.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>“His heart beats faintly; you have not killed him, miss&mdash;more’s
the pity, for he’s only a human serpent,” he
added, under his breath.</p>

<p>“He’s alive, you say? Oh, how glad I am! I did not
want his death on my soul, though I hate and fear him!”
cried Floy.</p>

<p>“Give me some water and a towel, miss, and I’ll stanch
the blood and see how bad the wound is,” added the detective.</p>

<p>She brought the desired things, and as he went to work,
he said:</p>

<p>“I was educated for a surgeon, so I know how to fix
him all right. It’s only a superficial wound through the
side of his neck, and I can sew it up all right before he
comes to himself.”</p>

<p>He brought out a tiny surgical-case from his coat-pocket
and sewed up the cut, after which he bandaged
it nicely.</p>

<p>“Oh, how fortunate that you had those things along!”
cried Floy, admiringly.</p>

<p>“Yes; they often come in handy in a detective’s business
as well as a surgeon’s,” smiled Floyd Landon. “So!
he will do nicely, I think, and presently he will revive.
Before then we must be out of the way.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“OH, HOW BLEST I AM!” CRIED FLOY.</span></h2>


<p>Floy looked at him inquiringly, and he said:</p>

<p>“Will you come with me to-night to New York and<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
the lady who wants you so much, or shall you go to
Mrs. Banks?”</p>

<p>“Not to her, though I love her dearly; for, oh! there
is danger for me in her vicinity, since it is the home of
Otho Maury, also. No; I must seek another hiding-place.
Oh, sir, you look at me strangely! You do not understand
my trouble, and I can not explain it, for&mdash;for&mdash;I
have a secret!” cried Floy, incoherently.</p>

<p>She looked down at Otho’s face in alarm, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, how ghastly he looks! Are you sure he is not
really dead?”</p>

<p>“He is not dead, and will be able to devise new deviltry
in a few weeks from now.”</p>

<p>“Then let us hasten away. Who is the lady&mdash;the
friend you said had employed you to find me?”</p>

<p>“Have you no suspicion?”</p>

<p>“Not the slightest,” she replied, honestly.</p>

<p>“Did you ever meet a Mrs. Beresford in Maury’s store
in New York?”</p>

<p>Floy blushed divinely at the mention of the name of
Beresford and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Yes; I saw her once. She bought real lace handkerchiefs
from me, and was so sweet and kind I have
loved her memory ever since.”</p>

<p>“She admired you very much,” smiled the detective.</p>

<p>“She told me I was pretty&mdash;that she liked to look at
me,” confessed Floy, naïvely.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is it; she was charmed with your beauty,
Miss Fane, and I applaud her good taste,” said Landon,
admiringly; and continued: “Did you know that Mrs.
Beresford’s only daughter is a great artist?”</p>

<p>“I had not heard anything about her, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is true, and Mrs. Beresford saw that your<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
face was the very one Miss Alva wanted as a model for
a picture of Cupid that she is painting.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Floy, clasping her hands in wondering
delight.</p>

<p>“So she told Miss Alva about you,” continued the
detective, “and they decided to try to secure you for a
model; but when they went to the store&mdash;it was the day
after the accident&mdash;you had disappeared. So they sent
for me to find you.”</p>

<p>He could not understand the wonderful radiance that
came upon Floy’s lovely face while he was speaking, making
her beauty almost unearthly.</p>

<p>She was thinking, joyously:</p>

<p>“Oh, how blest I am that I have found favor with
<em>his</em> mother&mdash;my darling’s mother&mdash;and his gifted sister!
They will take me into his dear home, and I will try to
win their love, so that when he comes and finds me there
they will be glad that I am his chosen one.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the plan? Will you come with me to
Mrs. Beresford?” asked Floyd Landon.</p>

<p>“Oh, so gladly&mdash;so gladly!” she cried, in a sort of
rapture.</p>

<p>“Then let us lose no time in starting. And&mdash;hadn’t
you better find some sort of a disguise&mdash;a thick veil anyhow&mdash;so
that you need not be recognized in going through
the town?” he suggested.</p>

<p>Floy pulled open the drawers and found an old-fashioned
traveling-wrap and thick veil and bonnet. She
put these on in a hurry, and they left the house with its
grim occupant, Otho Maury, lying silent on the floor,
not yet revived from his long swoon.</p>

<p>No one would have recognized the detective’s prim,
old-fashioned-looking traveling companion as merry little<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
Fly-away Floy. Her disguising costume was foreign in
style, in fact, had been worn by her mother on her return
from England.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“’TIS HOME WHERE’ER THE HEART IS.”</span></h2>


<p>“I can no longer wonder at my mother’s enthusiasm,”
thought Alva Beresford, on first beholding Floy.</p>

<p>It was not yet midnight when Floyd Landon arrived
at the Fifth Avenue mansion with his charge.</p>

<p>He knew that it was late to intrude, but under the
peculiar circumstances of the case, he deemed it best to
waive ceremony and go at once to the house.</p>

<p>His arrival was timely, for Miss Beresford was just
leaving her carriage on returning from a wedding-reception.
She was in magnificent evening-dress, and the
sheen of her diamonds fairly dazzled Floy’s eyes as she
gazed at the beautiful belle, while her features, so like
those of her brother, made her fond heart leap wildly in
her breast.</p>

<p>Floyd Landon presented his charge with a few explanatory
words, and Miss Beresford was exceedingly gracious.</p>

<p>“So good of you to bring her to me at once,” she cried,
as she pressed Floy’s little hand. “Now, you must come
into the house and tell me all about it,” she added, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I thank you, but the hour is late, and you must be
weary after the evening’s pleasure. I will postpone the
telling until another time, if you will permit me,” answered<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
Floyd Landon, anxious to get home to his wife,
whom he had left ailing when he went away that day.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning then, if you have leisure,” replied
the beautiful heiress; and after bidding him good-night,
she and Floy went up the white marble steps and
into the house.</p>

<p>Floy felt like one in a blissful dream. In entering
this splendid house, with its magnificent halls adorned
with potted plants, glimmering statues, and costly paintings,
she thought far less of the grandeur of the place
than of the fact that it was the home of her lover.</p>

<p>Every association breathed of him, and made the
strange house seem home-like at once to her fond, loving
heart.</p>

<p>She felt herself blessed in the strange freak of Fate
that had brought her to be a dweller beneath this roof.</p>

<p>“A few more days&mdash;just a few more days now&mdash;and
he too, will be here, my love, my love!” throbbed her
happy heart.</p>

<p>Alva led her upstairs to her own room, and summoned
her maid.</p>

<p>“I have brought home a guest&mdash;Miss Fane&mdash;who will
serve me as a model in future. Arrange the blue room
opposite mine for her occupancy,” she said, in a tone
that forbid curiosity.</p>

<p>When the maid had gone to do her bidding, she said,
kindly:</p>

<p>“My dear, you look positively radiant somehow, yet
surely you must be very tired.”</p>

<p>“I am not tired&mdash;I have come only a short journey&mdash;from
Mount Vernon&mdash;and I <em>am</em> so glad to be here, so
glad that I can be of service to you, Miss Beresford, that<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
every other emotion is swallowed up in pure joy!” exclaimed
the grateful girl.</p>

<p>Alva looked admiringly at the lovely face with its
radiant blue eyes and joy-flushed cheeks, and her heart
went out to her strongly, tenderly.</p>

<p>“You are a sweet, lovely child!” she exclaimed, impulsively.
“You have the most beautiful face in the
world! It is no wonder my mother thought your face
the ideal one for Cupid. Did you know that I wish to
paint you as the little god of Love?”</p>

<p>“Is it so?” cried Floy, delightedly; and every moment
she grew more lovely. The gladness of her heart was
reflected charmingly in her face.</p>

<p>She had thrown off her disguising wraps, and in her
simple attire was so lovely that Miss Beresford wondered
how she would look in rich attire like her own&mdash;diamonds,
laces, and rustling white satin.</p>

<p>“But she does not need them, she is lovely enough
in her girlish bloom without adornment,” she thought,
quickly.</p>

<p>“I shall not ask you to-night to tell me where you
have been hidden away so long, dear, for you must have
your rest, but to-morrow, in my studio, you shall tell me
everything,” she said, as she conducted Floy to an exquisite
room across the hall.</p>

<p>Floy looked about her in delight.</p>

<p>Was this beautiful room, all blue and silver, so dainty
and bride-like, to be all her own, to sleep in and rest in
day by day?</p>

<p>Alva saw her glance with secret perturbation at her
cheap attire, and knew she was thinking of the contrast.</p>

<p>“You did not bring your trunk,” she said, cheerfully.
“Never mind, we will remedy all that to-morrow. I<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
will send Honora shopping for you, and she has charming
taste.”</p>

<p>“You are too kind to me. I&mdash;I have no money, and&mdash;I
can not accept charity,” faltered Floy, her sensitive
pride taking alarm.</p>

<p>“You proud little Cupid, it will not be charity. Aren’t
you going to pose for me? I shall put your face into
lovely pictures, and I shall have to pay you well for the
privilege. The new outfit will be a payment in advance
on my debt, that is all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you&mdash;thank you!” cried Floy, dimpling
with delight at the thought of having new clothes when
St. George came home.</p>

<p>“For I do not wish him to see me shabby and unsuited
in my dress to my beautiful surroundings,” she thought,
with honest pride in herself.</p>

<p>Alva bid her a kind good-night and retired, leaving her
in such a flutter of delight that it was several hours before
her eyelids closed, thought and hope were so busy
over the future.</p>

<p>The next morning she breakfasted alone with Alva
and the latter said:</p>

<p>“I did not tell you last night that my parents sailed
for Europe yesterday.”</p>

<p>Floy looked so surprised that she added:</p>

<p>“They read in the paper a telegraphic dispatch from
the London reporter that my brother St. George is quite
ill in London.”</p>

<p>“<em>Ill!</em>” almost shrieked poor Floy.</p>

<p>Her eyes drooped, her rosy face went white, she trembled
so that Miss Beresford thought she was going to
faint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“My dear child, what is the matter&mdash;are you also ill?”
she demanded, in alarm and surprise.</p>

<p>Floy recovered herself with an effort.</p>

<p>“Pardon me; I felt deathly sick for a moment,” she
faltered; then added: “I am afraid I lost what you were
saying, Miss Beresford. But please go on; I am better
now.”</p>

<p>“I was saying that my brother is ill in London, and
my parents sailed yesterday to bring him home as soon
as he is better,” replied Alva.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope he is not very ill!” sighed Floy, very pale
still, in spite of her declaration that she was better.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I have no idea that there is much the matter
with St. George, for he would have had his physician
cable us, of course, if he had been really ill. These dispatches
from foreign correspondents to their papers are
often greatly exaggerated in the interests of sensationalism,”
replied Alva, carelessly; adding, after a moment:
“But my parents fairly idolize their only son, so they
took quick alarm and hurried over the sea to bring home
the invalid.”</p>

<p>They left the table, and Alva led Floy to her beautiful
studio, where wealth and taste had united in adorning
a most beautiful apartment. Priceless rugs covered part
of the inlaid floor, and exquisite statues gleamed whitely
from velvet-draped niches, while pictures were scattered
everywhere, some framed, some in an unfinished condition
on their easels, yet all showing the work of a master-hand.
Here and there were vases of flowers perfuming
the air with their sweetness, while silken curtains of rare
design filtered the garish light of day into soft, rosy
shadows.</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Alva watched with delight Floy’s keen appreciation
of everything, as she wandered from picture to picture,
drinking in their beauty with eager, appreciative eyes.</p>

<p>“She has a cultured soul, this lovely wild flower. I
shall never be bored by her, no matter how much we are
thrown together,” thought Alva, gladly.</p>

<p>Then she drew the covering from her latest work and
directed Floy to look at it.</p>

<p>The girl approached, and the first sight of the painting
charmed her, it was so life-like&mdash;the dancing youths and
maidens were so natural, the woods and water so perfect.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, in an ecstasy; and Alva smiled, well
pleased.</p>

<p>“You see it is not yet completed,” she explained.
“See there the figure of Cupid, with his bow and arrow.
When I have given him your enchanting face, it will be
finished; and I am so impatient to begin that I will
commence painting this very morning!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NEAR TO DEATH.</span></h2>


<p>Alva painted unweariedly for several hours, and declared
herself charmed with her lovely, patient model.</p>

<p>Floy was enthusiastic, too. She declared that she could
not be grateful enough to Miss Beresford for putting
her face in that enchanting picture.</p>

<p>“Only think!” she cried. “When I am dead and
gone&mdash;when the light has faded from my eyes&mdash;when
this form of mine is dust in a forgotten grave&mdash;this
beauty will live on upon the deathless canvas, and some
one may say of me: ‘She was so pretty, this little Floy
Fane, that Miss Beresford made her face immortal by
painting it as Cupid.’”</p>

<p>Alva saw that the girl’s delight was genuine, and it
charmed her very much.</p>

<p>“I shall put you in other pictures, too,” she said.
“Last night, after I left you, the thought came to me to
paint your portrait in a simple white gown, and call it
‘Maidenhood.’ Do you like the idea?”</p>

<p>“I am charmed!” cried Floy.</p>

<p>“You remember Longfellow’s ‘Maidenhood’?” continued
Alva; and she murmured some of the verses:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“‘Maiden with the meek brown eyes,
</div><div class="indent0a">In whose orbs a shadow lies,
</div><div class="indent0a">Like the dusk in evening skies.
</div></div><div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“‘Thou whose locks outshine the sun,

</div></div></div></div>

<p>“How old are you, Floy?”</p>

<p>“Almost seventeen.”</p>

<p>“A charming age&mdash;the time of illusions! I am twenty-eight,
dear&mdash;almost an old maid.”</p>

<p>“You do not look twenty.”</p>

<p>“So they tell me; but my heart is even older than my
years,” with a suppressed sigh; then, smiling: “Have
you ever had a lover, Floy? Why, how frightened you
look&mdash;how deeply you blush! Never mind; you needn’t
answer, child; your face tells its own conscious story.”</p>

<p>“Oh, if she only knew the name of that lover!”
thought Floy, with quickened heart-beats; but she did not
feel much frightened. She hoped that the haughty Beresfords
who admired her so much would find it easy to
forgive St. George for his choice.</p>

<p>But in the meantime she must keep her pretty secret,
as he had commanded her to do. She would not tell
them a word till he should take her by the hand and say:</p>

<p>“Pretty little Floy is my heart’s choice.”</p>

<p>How impatiently she waited for that day, only God
and the angels knew.</p>

<p>For the thought of his illness and the secret terror
that he might die, far away from his beloved, kept Floy
awake many hours each night.</p>

<p>But if Alva were uneasy over her sick brother, she
concealed it cleverly, or did not think that her pretty
model had any interest in the subject, for she never mentioned
it again until more than a week had passed away.</p>

<p>Then Floy, tortured by a secret unrest, cried out one
day:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[136]</span></p>

<p>“Have you never heard from your parents yet?”</p>

<p>Alva was so busy she did not look around from her
picture, and only answered:</p>

<p>“No. It is only a week since they went, you see, and
they would not send a cablegram unless St. George was
very ill. I dare say it was all a false alarm.”</p>

<p>Floy feared it was not, for although she had written
secretly to the postmaster at Mount Vernon to forward
her letters, none had been received, and she knew there
must be some reason for his ceasing to write.</p>

<p>At last she ventured on a little loving letter to him,
but by freak of fate it went astray, and the lover’s heart
lost the joy it would have brought.</p>

<p>At length there came letters for Alva from abroad,
and then she said to Floy:</p>

<p>“It was all true about my brother, mamma says. He
has been very, very ill with brain fever, and came near
to death.”</p>

<p>They were sitting alone in the twilight, so Alva did not
see the corpse-like pallor of the listener’s face as Floy
clinched her dimpled hands together in her lap, silently
praying Heaven not to let her cry out in her anguish and
betray her loving secret.</p>

<p>“But,” continued Alva, “the crisis passed the day they
reached London, and my brother is slightly better. The
physicians say he may recover&mdash;unless he has a relapse.”</p>

<p>Floy could not answer one word. It was all that she
could do to keep her reeling senses from failing altogether.</p>

<p>St. George, her heart’s love, her idol, ill unto death,
and parted from her by the breadth of the terrible sea!
Oh, it was cruel, cruel!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[137]</span></p>

<p>And she dared not cry out to this woman, his own
sister:</p>

<p>“Pity me, sympathize with me, for I love him; he is
my own, my own, and if he dies my heart will break!”</p>

<p>Not one word of grief must she utter unless the tidings
came that he was dead.</p>

<p>Then she might open the flood-gates of her love and
despair, for betrayal would not matter when he was
gone.</p>

<p>But she sat like a stone in the twilight of the room, so
cold, so white, so still, and waited for Alva to say more.</p>

<p>Alva was in a bitter mood, that came to her sometimes
when the memory of her past was revived.</p>

<p>She had been struggling to repress herself, but all in
vain, for now, half forgetting Floy’s presence, she cried
out with passionate indignation:</p>

<p>“If he dies, that poor boy, my brother, his broken
heart and early death will lie at his mother’s door!”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“THE SILENCE OF A BROKEN HEART.”</span></h2>


<p>Floy leaned forward and clutched Alva’s arm with icy
fingers.</p>

<p>“Oh, for God’s sake, tell me what you mean!” she
faltered, imploringly.</p>

<p>“Why, what is it to you, child?” exclaimed Alva, startled
out of herself by Floy’s emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing, nothing; pardon me, Miss Beresford.
But I was so sorry for you and for <em>him</em>, for&mdash;for you<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
spoke of a broken heart,” sobbed Floy, drawing back in
dismay.</p>

<p>Miss Beresford was silent one moment, then she
reached out and caressed Floy’s golden head with one
jeweled hand, while she answered:</p>

<p>“I am not offended, Floy. You startled me from a
painful retrospect, that was all. I did not mean to
answer you rudely, dear.”</p>

<p>And loving the girl like a younger sister, perhaps
craving her sympathy in this sad hour, she threw reserve
to the winds and poured out her brother’s story.</p>

<p>Nothing was kept back; his letter telling of his love,
his mother’s anger, her cruel reply, then the brief renunciation
of the outraged son.</p>

<p>“Was he not brave?” cried Alva, with kindling eyes.
“He threw away everything for Love’s sake. Would
that I, his sister, had been so true to self.”</p>

<p>“You! you!” cried Floy, in tears and wonder.</p>

<p>“Hush! hush! I did not mean to refer to myself!”
cried Alva; and sure as she was of the girl’s sympathy,
she repented of her momentary self-betrayal, and
wrapped herself in a mantle of reserve.</p>

</div></div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>There was silence for a little while. Floy was fighting
down the ache in her heart so that her voice would not
betray her when she spoke.</p>

<p>Then she breathed, timidly:</p>

<p>“This illness of&mdash;your brother’s&mdash;its cause?”</p>

<p>“His trouble, of course. He was in love with a beautiful
girl, but he loved his parents well also; and he was
his mother’s pride and idol. She would have thought a
princess unworthy of him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” thought Floy, despairingly.</p>

<p>“This very journey my brother took to Europe,” continued
Alva, “was planned by mamma to break him
from a fancy he seemed to have for the beautiful Miss
Maury of Mount Vernon. We did not admire the girl,
and mamma was wild at the thought of having her for
a daughter. But Maybelle was angling for him so
skillfully that mamma had papa to telegraph him to come
home, to go across the sea at a minute’s notice.” She
sighed, and added: “You can see from this one incident
how resolute mamma can be when roused to action. And
as for papa, he always takes sides with her in everything.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;perhaps they will persuade your brother
to desert his love,” breathed Floy, tremulously.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; or perhaps he will cling to her in spite
of all; and in either case he will be unhappy,” returned
Alva, not dreaming how cruelly her words stabbed Floy’s
loving heart. She continued, sadly enough: “You see,
if St. George marries the girl, they will disinherit him,
and he will have so little money, poor fellow&mdash;having
been used to luxury all his life&mdash;that he will not know
how to live. Poverty will crush him, and perhaps he will<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
regret that he ever saw the girl. Ah, me! Will you
ring for lights, please, dear Floy?”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">PRIDE BROUGHT LOW.</span></h2>


<p>St. George Beresford’s precautions that his parents
should not know of his illness were useless.</p>

<p>It was not probable that the son of an American millionaire
could fall ill in London without the knowledge
of the ubiquitous reporters for the American newspapers.</p>

<p>So the first news the Beresfords had of their son’s illness
was brought through a special to a New York daily
paper.</p>

<p>Something seemed to snap like a too hardly strained
cord in the mother’s heart when she read the paragraph
and she fell in a heavy swoon to the floor.</p>

<p>The thought had struck through her mind that if her
son died it would have been through her pride and harshness
that it had happened.</p>

<p>She had been too imperious and too hasty. She should
have tried gentler means with her spoiled but noble and
loving boy.</p>

<p>She realized it all too late as she cried out to her anxious
husband:</p>

<p>“You must take me to my son. He must forgive
me before he dies!”</p>

<p>“We will start at the earliest possible hour,” he replied,
huskily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>Most fortunately a steamer was leaving New York
that day, and they had no difficulty in securing a first-class
passage.</p>

<p>“It will be lonely for you, dear, without us. Perhaps
you had better go on to Newport next week, as we
had planned,” they said to Alva, who answered, cheerily:</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no; I will await your return here. I am not
anxious to begin the gay season at the seashore.”</p>

<p>So she remained in the large, splendid mansion with
the servants, and the anxious parents set out on their
journey.</p>

<p>Oh, those weary days upon the sea, how long they
were, how heavily they dragged to those two hearts
aching with remorse and grief!</p>

<p>“We were too harsh,” sighed the father.</p>

<p>“It was all my fault,” sobbed the mother. “If I had
pleaded for my boy you would have yielded, for your
pride was not so great as mine.”</p>

<p>“And, after all, the girl might not have been so objectionable.
She was a poor girl,” he said, “but poverty
is not a crime, dear.”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no; and we have wealth enough to spare as a
royal dowry for our son’s bride. But, oh, the doubt as to
whether she is pure and worthy!&mdash;for St. George is a
noble son&mdash;it is that which tortures so cruelly. Oh, why
did he not tell us who she was, that we might have judged
for ourselves.”</p>

<p>“It may be that he feared our interference with the girl
during his absence.”</p>

<p>“And he was right; for had I known where to find
her, I should have bribed her, if possible, to give up her
claim on St. George&mdash;yes, to go away and hide herself<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
until the affair blew over,” confessed Mrs. Beresford,
frankly.</p>

<p>And had any one told the proud lady that she had employed
a high-priced detective to seek the girl her son
loved, and bring her home to the Fifth Avenue palace,
she would have thought they had taken leave of their
senses.</p>

<p>The weary journey was over at last, and they reached
London.</p>

<p>Soon they were bending over their son’s sick-bed.</p>

<p>But alas! it was enough to break their hearts, that
sight.</p>

<p>The lethargy of that terrible illness following on acute
delirium held the patient in its grasp, and he did not
recognize the fond, anxious faces that bent over him, his
ears were deaf to their words of love.</p>

<p>This condition continued for days, and they feared that
the patient would sink into death without knowing the
remorse and penitence they had crossed the sea to pour
into his ears.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">TOO LATE!</span></h2>


<p>Oh, those days and nights of sorrow and suspense!
The tortured parents would never forget them.</p>

<p>The memory of their harshness was a lash to conscience
that never ceased to sting.</p>

<p>In the weary nightly vigils, when they hung over the
sufferer’s bedside, the mother prayed, unceasingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[143]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, God, give me back my boy, that I may atone!”</p>

<p>All her pride was brought low. If she could have
known where to find the mysterious girl her son loved,
she would have dragged her by force, if necessary, to her
son’s bedside, hoping that the sight of her beauty would
lure him back to life.</p>

<p>Oh, the strength of a mother’s love! What will it not
endure and yield and suffer for the sake of the beloved
one!</p>

<p>The proud woman learned, in that fiery trial, all the
strength of her love for her son&mdash;knew that it was
stronger than pride or ambition, mightier than death.</p>

<p>“Give him back that I may atone!” was her continual
prayer, until it seemed as if God must have heard and
pitied at last.</p>

<p>The day came when he opened his heavy eyes and
knew his mother.</p>

<p>They lightened with a faint gleam of pleasure, and
from that moment he began to convalesce.</p>

<p>Memory lay dormant in his mind for days; but it wakened
at last, as she knew by the sudden change on his
face.</p>

<p>It was twilight, and the windows were open, that warm
summer evening, to admit the pleasant air. The western
sky was still faintly roseate with hues of the fading sunset,
and the sounds of the London streets were softening
with the close of the weary day of toil.</p>

<p>Mr. Beresford had gone out for a walk, and the
mother and son were alone.</p>

<p>She sat at the head of his low couch, softly stroking
back the dark hair from his high, white brow with her
jeweled slender white hand.</p>

<p>It made her heart ache to see how thin and wasted<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
he was, and to think that her cruelty had wrought the
change.</p>

<p>His hollow dark eyes were turned toward the open
window, watching the rosy-purple sky with a far-off
look.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw his whole face change as with a
spasm, and his lips contract as with pain. She knew
that memory had reasserted itself, by the anguish in
his eyes.</p>

<p>Impulsively she stooped and pressed her lips to his
brow, and it was not all her fancy that he shrunk from
the caress.</p>

<p>“My son!” she cried, entreatingly; but there was no
reply, and she continued: “Forgive me!”</p>

<p>She knelt down by his side and put her arms around
him. The proud, beautiful woman had never humbled
herself like this to any one before in all her life.</p>

<p>“St. George, listen to me,” she murmured, tremulously,
but he could not speak. She felt his whole form
shaking with emotion.</p>

<p>She cried out, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Oh, my son, I see that you remember everything, and
you shrink from me. You feel that I was hard and cruel,
and I know now that I was wrong, that I had no right to
write you that cruel letter. My heart almost broke when
I heard of your illness, and I came to you at once&mdash;your
father with me&mdash;to tell you that we repent our
harshness and wish to atone.”</p>

<p>No answer yet, and she felt the wasted form heaving
beneath the touch with heavy, repressed sobs that it
seemed unmanly to utter.</p>

<p>“St. George, do you understand me, my dear?” she
murmured, tenderly. “We repent our harshness, we<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
withdraw our objections to your marriage. Whoever the
girl is&mdash;and we feel that she must be good and pure, or
she would not be our son’s choice&mdash;we will take her to
our hearts for your sake.”</p>

<p>She paused for his answer, but it was only a succession
of heavy sobs, such as can only burst from the breast of
a man who gives up the struggle against emotion and lets
the storm sweep him away.</p>

<p>It was a tempest of grief before which the grieving
mother was appalled.</p>

<p>She put her arms around him and wept with him in
passionate sympathy.</p>

<p>Mr. Beresford stole back to the room so quietly that
neither heard him. He hovered over them in perplexity
of grief.</p>

<p>At length he saw that the tempestuous sobs were
stifled by a manly will, and St. George answered, faintly,
to his mother’s implorings:</p>

<p>“Alas! it is too late.”</p>

<p>“No, no, my son! Do not grieve my heart with such
cruel words!” she cried. “You will soon be strong
enough to come home with us, and then you shall marry
when you will. Shall I write to Alva to seek out your
betrothed and bring her home to greet you when we
return?”</p>

<p>A strangled sob shook the invalid’s form.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, how good you are to me&mdash;just like an
angel! I forgive all that there is to forgive, and&mdash;there
will never be any more discord between us, please Heaven.
I shall never have any one to love henceforth but you
three&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;<em>she</em> is dead!”</p>

<p>“Great Heaven!” cried his mother, in amazement.</p>

<p>“<em>She</em> is dead,” he repeated, with the calmness of despair.<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
“That was the secret of my sickness, dear mother.

<span class="cheaderfont">“HE IS FICKLE AND FALSE&mdash;MY LOVER WHOM I TRUSTED SO FONDLY!&mdash;HOW CAN I BEAR THIS PAIN AND LIVE?”</span></h2>


<p>Mr. Beresford, when he saw himself discovered, advanced
to the bedside.</p>

<p>He was a tall, portly gentleman, with kind brown eyes
and a pleasant face that beamed with joy as he said:</p>

<p>“A letter from Alva at last!”</p>

<p>His wife sunk back in her chair and eagerly perused
it. Then she handed it to her husband, and turned again
to her son.</p>

<p>“I suppose Alva is at Newport?” he said, trying to
bring his thoughts back from the painful theme that
held them&mdash;the loss of his darling.</p>

<p>But it was hard to remember anything else now, when
sorrow was at its flood-tide, sweeping like a torrent over
his heart.</p>

<p>“No; Alva is at home. She will not leave New York
till we return,” his mother returned.</p>

<p>“But she will be very lonely, I fear.”</p>

<p>“No; she is very busy painting, and Alva loves art better
than society, you know. Besides, she has a companion&mdash;a<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
lovely young girl whom she has employed as a
model.”</p>

<p>Alva’s letter had not been very long, and she had chronicled
the finding of Floy in one careless paragraph:</p>

<p>“Floyd Landon was so fortunate as to find Cupid
the very day you left the city, and brought her to me at
once, so I hope to finish my picture before your return.”</p>

<p>St. George, in his bitter despair over Floy’s supposed
death, took no interest in his sister’s pretty model, and
Mrs. Beresford, of course, had no idea that her son’s
sweetheart was domiciled beneath her roof, while her
lover mourned her as dead.</p>

<p>The mere utterance of her name by St. George would
have solved the mystery, and saved him hours and days
and weeks of pain, hastening his recovery by the force
of joy; for the influence of mental emotions on the
bodily health is too well known to be disputed, and the
effects of grief and sorrow in breaking down health and
retarding recovery are especially significant.</p>

<p>So the long summer days waxed and waned until it
was well into July before the invalid’s tedious convalescence
became confirmed enough for him to be removed
from his room to a pleasant place by the sea. Here he
remained for a week, gaining strength more rapidly,
and at last asking to be taken home.</p>

<p>A fancy had seized him to revisit the scenes made
sacred by their connection with his lost love, and to find
her lonely little grave, unmarked perhaps by monument
or flower, and to raise a costly stone above the spot.</p>

<p>But he did not confide these thoughts to his parents.</p>

<p>The subject had never been revived between them
again.</p>

<p>St. George had a bitter, secret consciousness that he<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
did not have their sympathy in his sorrow, and that at
heart the death of his betrothed was a relief to them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford had indeed hinted to her son that a
certain fair English dame, a dainty Lady Maud whom he
had met the previous year, was not indifferent to him,
and would be a very welcome daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>But her son had answered, with the indifference of ill-health
and an aching heart:</p>

<p>“I would not want her though she were ‘the daughter
of a hundred earls!’”</p>

<p>And his father had whispered to his wife:</p>

<p>“Leave the lad alone awhile. His grief is too fresh
and new to bear consolation yet. Time will bring the
only balm&mdash;forgetfulness.”</p>

<p>So when St. George renewed the subject of going
home, they did not say him nay.</p>

<p>They, too, were anxious to return, and by the middle
of July had engaged their state-rooms on a steamer
of the fastest line.</p>

<p>Bidding farewell to all their little coterie of English
friends at Brighton, they were soon <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for home
and Alva.</p>

<p>St. George was gaining strength but slowly, and his
large, dark eyes looked out of a wan, pale face, whose
expression was too sad for tears.</p>

<p>This home-coming was inexpressibly bitter to his tortured
heart, and his pale, grave, handsome face made
him an object of romantic interest to all the lady passengers.</p>

<p>But he did not reciprocate their interest, he cared
nothing for black eyes or blue that looked at him with gay
coquetry or tender sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[149]</span></p>

<p>He said to himself that since Floy was dead he could
never love again.</p>

<p>He held himself moodily apart from every passenger
but one.</p>

<p>This was a blonde nobleman of barely middle age, very
handsome and grave-looking&mdash;Lord Alexander Miller,
who had recently inherited by his father’s death a grand
estate in Devonshire.</p>

<p>He was going over for a tour of the States, he told
the Beresfords, but his grave blue eyes had in them a look
as if he should not enjoy anything very much, the look
of a man with some secret sorrow tugging at his heart-strings.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was this secret kinship of sorrow that drew
the two men together on shipboard, for each recognized
a subtile affinity in the other, and so they became fast
friends.</p>

<p>There was something, too, in the nobleman’s fair,
frank face, so debonair though so serious, that fascinated
the younger man. Where had he seen such blue eyes before
in the dim past?</p>

<p>It came to him at last with a shock of mingled pain
and pleasure.</p>

<p>His new friend bore a subtile, haunting, charming likeness
to his dead love Floy. And for this likeness St.
George admired him all the more.</p>

<p>By the time they reached New York, St. George was
loath to part with his fascinating friend.</p>

<p>He pressed him to become his guest. The reply startled
him.</p>

<p>“I shall be most happy to visit you later on, but for
the present I am going to Mount Vernon, New York,
where I have&mdash;friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>It was a startling answer to St. George, who had also
planned an early trip to Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>Why he wished to go he hardly knew, except to revisit
in silence and sorrow the places sacred to his brief, ill-fated
love-dream.</p>

<p>“As for the Maury’s, they need not know I am there.
I shall not call, for I despise that scheming Maybelle,”
he decided, remembering how falsely she had told Floy
she was engaged to marry him.</p>

<p>But he did not tell the nobleman that he also was soon
to visit Mount Vernon. He parted from him with frank
regret, expressing the hope that they might soon meet
again.</p>

<p>Then they went on shore, and there was Alva radiant
with joy to meet them.</p>

<p>She had come down in the carriage to meet them, and
tears flashed into her bright eyes as she looked at her
darling brother so pale, so changed, so sad.</p>

<p>Her mother had written to her simply that her son’s
love affair was ended forever, making no mention of the
girl’s death, and Alva had been very indignant, saying
to Floy:</p>

<p>“Mamma has made him give up his love. I feared she
would, but I hoped St. George would hold out against
her arguments. I see how it is. He loves mamma so
dearly&mdash;never son adored a mother so blindly&mdash;and she
has made him think that the girl is unworthy of him.”</p>

<p>Floy choked back a rising sob, and sat like a statue in
her chair, fearing to breathe lest she betray her cruel
secret.</p>

<p>She was as proud as she was beautiful, this willful
little Floy.</p>

<p>In the long happy weeks since she had been here with<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
Alva she had dreamed some happy dreams, but now they
were all over.</p>

<p>At first she had been glad to be here with her lover’s
sister, and she had pictured to herself over and over his
joy when he should come home and find her here an inmate
of his home, a pet with his loved ones. Surely,
then, it would be easy to win their liking for his chosen
bride.</p>

<p>But when Alva’s confidences showed Floy the overweening
pride of the Beresfords, she began to be frightened
even of charming Alva.</p>

<p>She said to herself in weary nightly vigils:</p>

<p>“She, too, is proud, although she pretends to take
her brother’s part. I can see that she has little sympathy
with unequal marriages. If she but guessed that I am the
girl her brother loves, she would send me away from the
shelter of this roof.”</p>

<p>And in her terror of the cold world outside, her fear
of her foes, and her longing to stay here till her lover’s
return, poor Floy held fast her wretched little secret of
love, scarcely daring to breathe when Alva named her
brother’s name in praise or blame.</p>

<p>But that last conjecture of Alva’s as to her brother’s
resignation to his mother’s will nearly broke the poor
child’s heart.</p>

<p>She could not doubt Alva’s word. It must be true that
among them all, in their pride of name and place, they
had turned his heart against her, his absent little love.</p>

<p>“He is fickle and false, my lover whom I trusted in so
fondly! How can I bear this pain and live?” she moaned
to her stricken heart, in the silence of her terrible despair.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“NOT TILL LOVE COMES.”</span></h2>


<p>But we must digress a short while from the main
points of our story to note what became of our villain,
Otho Maury, after Floyd Landon and our heroine left
him unconscious on the floor, to recover at his leisure
from his long swoon.</p>

<p>Never was a villain assured of success in a nefarious
design more cleverly checkmated.</p>

<p>In a few minutes after their departure, Otho revived,
and lifted his head in wonder at his position.</p>

<p>A darting pain in his wounded neck recalled him
sharply to a sense of all that had happened.</p>

<p>He had gone to Suicide Place to search for Floy, and
found her; but she was armed, and had attacked him
desperately with a murderous looking dagger.</p>

<p>He had swooned with the pain of the wound she gave
him, and knew no more.</p>

<p>How long ago had that been? How long had he been
lying here? And where was Floy?</p>

<p>He called her name faintly in the silence, but only the
echoes of the grim old house gave reply.</p>

<p>“She has fled the scene believing that I am dead, curse
her!” he muttered, vindictively, dragging himself up
out of the slippery pool of blood beneath him, and dropping
heavily into an arm-chair. Then he discovered, to
his surprise, that his neck had been carefully bandaged.</p>

<p>Not knowing, of course, of the presence of the detective
who had come upon the scene the moment after
he swooned, he was filled with wonder at the fact that
Floy had apparently bandaged his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>“But she has escaped me again! The foul fiend must
have helped her to drive that blow into my neck!” he
muttered, angrily; adding: “But she would not have
found me such an easy victim&mdash;I could have grappled
with her and taken away the weapon&mdash;only that I was
unnerved and trembling from the sights I had seen
before I entered this room.”</p>

<p>He shuddered and glanced fearfully at the door, as
though expecting some unearthly presence to appear.</p>

<p>“Alone in a haunted house!” he muttered, fearfully.
“I that always laughed at spooks and phantoms! But
I shall never deny them again. I have stumbled by accident
on the secret of this old house, and I know that it
has its restless ghost. What if I could turn my knowledge
to account, and&mdash;&mdash; Ugh! what was that?”</p>

<p>He broke off, shuddering, for a fiend’s laugh seemed
to echo in the stillness&mdash;the laugh of a fiend who has
tempted some poor soul to its eternal ruin. It was more
than the unstrung nerves of the man could bear.</p>

<p>With a muttered imprecation, he seized his hat from
the floor, where it was lying, and groped his way out of
the dismal house into the sweet night air.</p>

<p>But as he closed the door and turned from the accursed
threshold, that fiendish, mocking laugh seemed to follow
him with taunting echoes down the road.</p>

<p>Slowly and painfully he made his way home, thankful
that the pall of midnight covered the earth, so that none
saw him in the blood-soaked garments he wore.</p>

<p>Going to Maybelle’s room, he told her what had happened,
and asked her to examine the wound.</p>

<p>Shuddering at sight of the blood, his sister carefully
unwrapped the bandages, and found that the wound&mdash;a<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
very slight one, though it had bled freely&mdash;had already
been carefully dressed.</p>

<p>“Your swoon must have been a long one, to enable her
to do all this before she fled from the house,” said Maybelle,
as she carefully replaced the bandages.</p>

<p>Otho was bitterly chagrined at the failure of his scheme
and Floy’s second escape from his devilish machinations.</p>

<p>“And the worst of it is that I can not follow up her
track for some time now. I shall be obliged to keep my
room several days with this mark of affection she has
given me,” he growled.</p>

<p>Maybelle wept in bitterness of spirit; but she had no reproaches
to offer him now. He had done all that he
could, and was not to blame for his failure.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if her lovely rival must indeed
bear a charmed life, so cleverly had she escaped each
time from the machinations of her enemies.</p>

<p>Her chances of ever winning Beresford grew each
day less and less; but so madly had she fixed her heart
upon him that it seemed to her without that hope she
must die.</p>

<p>It was less than a year since she had known him, but
her jealousy had altered all her life.</p>

<p>Before she met him, Maybelle had been simply a handsome,
selfish girl, ambitious to make a grand match&mdash;even
to secure a title, if possible.</p>

<p>Mrs. Vere de Vere had abetted all her desires; but no
grand suitor had fallen into the net they spread until
Beresford’s careless flirting had awakened hopes never
to be realized, and, alas! roused the sleeping devil in a
nature well endowed with capabilities for evil.</p>

<p>What a potent factor is Love in all the affairs of life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[155]</span></p>

<p>Maybelle’s unhappy love and thwarted ambition had
roused all the worst passions of her nature. She would

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SEARCHING IN VAIN.</span></h2>


<p>It was a week before Otho could mingle with the world
again in his search for the brave girl who had so strangely
eluded him.</p>

<p>And then her disappearance became as strange as it
had seemed the first time.</p>

<p>Naturally it did not once occur to him that Floy had
found a powerful protector in the person of Miss Beresford.</p>

<p>The splendid house on Fifth Avenue, where the heiress
lived, was the last one he would have thought of searching
for the missing girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>Yet in that splendid casket Floy, like some beautiful
precious jewel, was hidden from his sight.</p>

<p>The fair girl in her modesty had refrained from acquainting
her kind employer with the story of her persecution
by Otho Maury. She thought:</p>

<p>“If I told her all, she might think me boastful and
vain.”</p>

<p>And she was too anxious for that lady’s good opinion
to run such a risk by lack of discretion.</p>

<p>She had even secured the detective’s promise of silence
on the subject.</p>

<p>“Do not tell Miss Beresford about that villain. You
can simply say you found me at Suicide Place,” she had
urged while they were on the train coming to New York.</p>

<p>Thinking it could do no harm to keep the little beauty’s
secret, he consented to what she asked, and in his subsequent
interview with Miss Beresford&mdash;in which she generously
remunerated him for his time and trouble in
finding her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</i>&mdash;he made no mention of Otho
Maury’s dastardly persecution of Floy.</p>

<p>Floy on her part was equally reticent.</p>

<p>The fall from the window of her lodging-house, as told
by herself, seemed a very tame affair.</p>

<p>“I lost my balance while looking down and fell into the
street,” she said. “As for my sensations while plunging
through the air, they were simply indescribable in their
horror; for, of course, I thought I was rushing upon instant
death. But the newsdealer’s shed broke my fall, and
I rolled down to the pavement actually unhurt, though
the shock of terror was succeeded by a long swoon, during
which I was removed to Bellevue. When I revived alone
in the waiting-room and found myself unhurt, I
ran away, and what more natural than that I should hide<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
myself in the only refuge that belonged to me&mdash;my old
home.”</p>

<p>She might have told her story, with all its romantic
embellishments, to Alva, and made herself a very heroine
of romance in that young lady’s eyes; but she shrunk
from doing so. She dreaded ridicule, perhaps disbelief of
her strange story.</p>

<p>“I am safe from my enemy’s machinations now, so I
will spare him until I can pour the whole story into St.
George’s ears,” she decided.</p>

<p>But Miss Beresford noticed that whenever she took the
little beauty for a drive in the park, as she often did, Floy
was always muffled in a very thick veil, through whose
meshes even the keen eyes of love or hate could scarcely
have detected her identity.</p>

<p>Miss Beresford remarked on this one day, and Floy
faltered out something about sunburn and freckles.</p>

<p>“Oh-h, I see! You are afraid of spoiling that rose-and-lily
complexion, and I can scarcely blame you,”
laughed Miss Beresford, whose rich olive complexion
could bear well the kisses of the wind and sun. Then,
as she saw how sensitively Floy blushed at her words,
she added: “Or, more likely, you are shy of the admiring
glances you would meet if unveiled.”</p>

<p>Floy had no answer ready, for she did not wish to tell
the lady that she feared to be recognized by an enemy.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A BOWER OF ROSES.</span></h2>


<p>So, while Floy’s enemy sought her all in vain, the day
of her lover’s return came at last.</p>

<p>It was two months now since their parting at the cottage
door, in the May moonlight, under the drooping vines
that shaded the porch&mdash;two months since that last kiss
of love so true and warm and tender.</p>

<p>The burning heats of July held the world in their hot
grasp, and the little spring flowers were faded and gone,
as were the tender hopes of Floy’s heart.</p>

<p>But all that last day she busied herself, flitting hither
and thither, helping Alva to make the house beautiful for
the returning dear ones.</p>

<p>“My brother loves flowers, especially roses, most
dearly; so we will have roses everywhere,” said Alva.</p>

<p>Floy’s heart beat fast, and she flushed, then paled
again, as she remembered that strange dream of roses&mdash;hers
and St. George’s&mdash;that summer night of their first
meeting&mdash;the dream that had seemed to draw their hearts
closer together.</p>

<p>“But his love grew cold before the sweet roses faded,”
she sighed from the bottom of her sad young heart.</p>

<p>Then something seemed to whisper tauntingly:</p>

<p>“He is rich, and grand, and handsome, and can choose
from the proudest women in the world. You should have
known from the first that you could not hold his fickle
fancy&mdash;a simple little maiden like you.”</p>

<p>As she passed and repassed the grand plate-glass mirrors
she would look into them anxiously, and with dissatisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>She saw that she was wonderfully lovely, that her hair
was bright as spun gold, her eyes as blue as violets, her
mouth a budding rose, her complexion as gloriously
tinted as a rose-lipped sea-shell, her dimples entrancing&mdash;but
after all it seemed to her a babyish kind of beauty.</p>

<p>She thought that the dark queenly style of beauty of
Alva and Maybelle was hundred times more attractive
than her blonde type of beauty.</p>

<p>Poor little Floy was sadly changed since she had heard
that her lover’s heart had grown cold.</p>

<p>She had lost the sauciness from her smile, the sparkle
from her eyes, and now and then a low, repressed sigh
heaved her tortured breast.</p>

<p>Miss Beresford could not help seeing the change.</p>

<p>It puzzled and perplexed her, until she said at last:</p>

<p>“You are not happy here with me, Floy. Perhaps I go
out too often in society and leave you here alone. I will
stay at home more hereafter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no&mdash;no; I am happy enough!” protested the poor
child; who felt relieved when she was alone and could
throw off the mask of indifference and let her tears
flow unrestrainedly over her broken love-dream.</p>

<p>She was so young, so friendless, and this love had become
a part of her life. She could not see how she was
going to live with this aching heart.</p>

<p>But she could not own her sorrow to St. George Beresford’s
sister, never&mdash;never! She would go away and
die sooner than that.</p>

<p>With her own little trembling white hands she carried
the great basket of roses to his luxurious suite of rooms.
She arranged every bud and flower to look their best for
his eyes, and the single bud in the tiny crystal vase on his
toilet-table she kissed twice, thinking:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“It is so sweet and fragrant he may perhaps wear it
on his coat, and think of me.”</p>

<p>Alva came in, and looked about her with delight.</p>

<p>“Why, Cupid, you have made it a bower of roses.
Are you sure you have left any for me?” she laughed,
admiringly.</p>

<p>“The florist said he would bring you some more,”
answered Floy, blushing because she had taken so many
for her darling’s room.</p>

<p>“Then you must finish the arrangements, dear; for it
is time to go and meet them now, and you refuse to accompany
me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could not&mdash;I could not!” Floy cried, affrighted;
and Miss Beresford cried, gayly:</p>

<p>“What a bashful child you are, Cupid!”</p>

<p>She was turning away when Floy caught her sleeve,
and gasped, imploringly:</p>

<p>“You must promise me one thing. I shall not see
them to-night. You will let me keep my room till to-morrow,
and not send for me to come down this evening?
For&mdash;for&mdash;of course you will have many things to talk
of, you four, and a stranger would be in the way.”</p>

<p>Alva saw that she was painfully in earnest, but she
thought it was only girlish bashfulness. She smiled indulgently,
and said:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. We shall have much to talk
of, and it might not interest a gay little girl like you.
Besides, they will be tired and will retire soon, so you
may easily be excused till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She hurried down to the waiting carriage, and Floy,
with one last tender glance about the room, went to her
task of decorating Mrs. Beresford’s suite of rooms, her
heart heavy with pain as she thought of the proud, rich<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
woman who had come between her son and his heart’s
true love.</p>

<p>When they came at last, Floy was at her window, peeping
between the lace curtains for one furtive glance at
the beloved face; and when she saw him step from the
carriage at last, so pale, so wan, so ill, like a wraith of
her debonair lover, it almost broke her fond, pitying heart.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A LITTLE HAND.</span></h2>


<p>Alva was right about the travelers being weary. They
retired early to their rooms that evening, St. George
first of all.</p>

<p>“How sweet, how beautiful!” he cried, when the odor
of the roses greeted him from every side.</p>

<p>He went up to the table, where a half-blown bud in
a slender crystal vase charmed him with its crimson
beauty.</p>

<p>“What a rich, warm, velvety scarlet rose&mdash;the flower
of love!” he exclaimed; and pressed his lips on the
curling petals.</p>

<p>In that instant a memory of Floy, his lost young love,
came to him in bitter agony.</p>

<p>He turned his head quickly toward the door.</p>

<p>It had seemed to him that he heard a long, low, quivering
sigh behind the shadowy <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portières</i> of violet silk.</p>

<p>And as he looked he saw vaguely&mdash;or was it only
fancy?&mdash;a tiny hand all white and dimpled, gleam an instant
on the shining silk, then vanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>“Alva!” he called, thinking she had followed him for a
tender little chat.</p>

<p>But there was no reply.</p>

<p>He sprung to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">portières</i> and thrust them aside, but
the long, brightly lighted corridor was empty.</p>

<p>He returned to his room slowly, thinking in a solemn
awe:</p>

<p>“It was not my fancy. I distinctly saw a little hand&mdash;small,
white and dimpled&mdash;vanishing away. It was <em>her</em>
hand&mdash;my Floy’s&mdash;beckoning me to the world of
shadows.”</p>

<p>All night, whether waking or sleeping, she was in his
thoughts&mdash;his dead love.</p>

<p>The odor of the roses, their bloom and beauty, had recalled
her to his mind as she had been the night that he
had dreamed of her among the roses&mdash;blessed dream that
had sent him to her side to save her from deadly peril!</p>

<p>She was with the angels now&mdash;lovely little Floy!&mdash;but
she had hovered near him to-night; he knew by the little
welcoming hand that had gleamed there a moment among
the folds of violet silk.</p>

<p>Dear little hand! How he had loved its dimpled
beauty! How soft and warm and thrilling it had been
when he pressed it! Alas! it was only an icy shadow
now!</p>

<p>“Dear Heaven, I wish that I might die and follow little
Floy to her bright home!” he groaned, despairingly.</p>

<p>Small wonder that his sleep was restless and disturbed,
and that in the morning he was wan and hollow-eyed as
some pale ghost.</p>

<p>Alva was shocked, but she did not tell him so; she
only showed her concern by the tenderest care.</p>

<p>“We must take you down to Newport before the end<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
of the week; New York is stifling now,” she said, with
a significant look at her mother.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am very anxious to get away from here,” rejoined
Mrs. Beresford, promptly, as she rose from the
table, adding: “I suppose your ‘Cupid’ is finished,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you must all come and pronounce on its
merits,” replied Alva, leading the way arm in arm with
her brother.</p>

<p>St. George had to profess a polite interest he did not
feel as they entered the studio and stood before the
favorite picture.</p>

<p>“Where is she&mdash;your lovely model? I had forgotten
her until this moment!” cried her mother.</p>

<p>“I will send for her,” returned Alva, speaking to a maid
who was in the room.</p>

<p>The girl went out, and then Alva turned to her brother,
who was gazing with startled eyes at the beautiful canvas.</p>

<p>“That face! that face!” he exclaimed, pointing wildly.</p>

<p>“I painted it from life,” she replied; adding, proudly:
“Can you imagine anything in life so perfectly beautiful?”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A STARTLING REVELATION.</span></h2>


<p>Alva looked intently at her brother, and she saw that
he was struggling with deep emotion.</p>

<p>It pleased her to see that her picture could affect him
so deeply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[164]</span></p>

<p>“Is it not beautiful&mdash;the face of Cupid? Can you
imagine anything living so perfectly beautiful?” she repeated.</p>

<p>Slowly, without taking his eyes from the lovely face,
St. George replied, dreamily:</p>

<p>“Yes, I can imagine it, for I knew the original in all
her living beauty, the fairest among women. Oh! my
sister, how exquisitely you have reproduced her upon
canvas! This picture must be mine, mine only&mdash;all that
is left me of poor dead Floy.”</p>

<p>They drew close to him&mdash;father, mother, sister&mdash;and
Alva caught his hand.</p>

<p>“What is that you mean? Have you ever known this
girl Floy&mdash;my lovely model?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Half impatiently, as if amazed at her stupidity, he answered:</p>

<p>“Have I not told you that she was mine&mdash;my little
sweetheart Floy, that the angels took away from me?”</p>

<p>“Floy Fane?” almost shrieked his mother; and he answered,
wearily:</p>

<p>“Yes; did you not know?”</p>

<p>And so they stood face to face with the truth.</p>

<p>Bonny little Floy, the lovely Cupid of Alva’s picture,
was St. George’s sweetheart, whom they had hated and
reviled&mdash;without knowing!</p>

<p>The shock was so great for a moment that no one
could speak, they simply looked at one another with joy,
and wonder in their eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[165]</span></p>

<p>They loved Floy in their hearts for her beauty and
sweetness and pride. Oh, if they had only known it
sooner, how much sorrow had been spared his suffering
heart! Even their pride could not have rebelled against
that lovely bride.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford found voice to exclaim:</p>

<p>“Why did you not tell me her name? Why did you
say that she was dead?”</p>

<p>Something in her face and voice so startled him that,
with his unstrung nerves, he could not stand upright.
Sinking heavily into a chair before the picture, he looked
up at her in wonder, answering bitterly:</p>

<p>“Why need I have told you her sacred name when I
knew that you would only execrate it because my darling
was a poor girl and not in the ‘set’ you adore? Besides,
where was the use? She was dead, poor little Floy!”</p>

<p>They gazed at one another questioningly, wondering
how they could break to him the truth that Floy was alive
and well. In his nervous, enfeebled condition, how would
the shock of joy affect him?</p>

<p>The father, with the usual masculine dread of scenes,
kept himself in the background, leaving it all to the two
women.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford’s heart swelled with joy as she thought
that now was the moment in which to atone for all her
cruelty.</p>

<p>She had been bitterly despondent over her son’s low
spirits and failing health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>She had fancied sometimes, in her trouble, that the
spirit of the beloved dead girl was drawing him by invisible
threads to rejoin her in the spirit world.</p>

<p>Against that subtile power of love she had felt herself
so impatient that she could have cried aloud for mercy,
in her wild despair.</p>

<p>Then, what joy, what relief, to know that the girl was
alive&mdash;a girl, too, so fair, so young, so innocent that she
need not be ashamed to present her to the world as her
son’s wife.</p>

<p>Her face fairly beamed with joy as she bent over him
asking, tenderly:</p>

<p>“My son, who told you that Floy Fane was dead?”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">JOY AND SORROW.</span></h2>


<p>St. George looked up at his mother, and it angered
him to see the look of joy on her face.</p>

<p>“She is so glad&mdash;so glad of my darling’s death that she
has not the grace to hide it, to feign a sympathy she can
not feel,” he thought, miserably.</p>

<p>“Answer me, dear,” she persisted, grasping his arm in
her excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>He turned his heavy eyes on her face, and said, reproachfully:</p>

<p>“You need not look so glad that she is dead, mother;
my grief is bitter enough without that. Well, it was Otho
Maury, if you wish to know who wrote me she was dead.
He sent me a paragraph from a daily paper. She died
by accident&mdash;fell from a fourth-story window. Oh,
God!” he ended, with a groan, putting his hand upon
his eyes as if to shut out some terrible sight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford drew back at her son’s reproach, and
signed to Alva that she could not go on; it must be her
task to break the truth to her brother.</p>

<p>She knelt down before him; she put her arm about his
shoulders, and her dark eyes, when she raised them to his
face, were streaming with tears&mdash;tears through which the
sunshine of joy broke gladly, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Dearest, we have news for you&mdash;joyful news. Can
you bear it?”</p>

<p>He started, his heavy eyes flashed with sudden hope.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he cried, hoarsely; and she answered:</p>

<p>“Florence Fane did indeed fall from the window&mdash;the
paragraph told the truth&mdash;but Mr. Maury was mistaken
about her death. She&mdash;she&mdash;lives!”</p>

<p>“Lives?” he cried.</p>

<p>And they never forgot the joy that transfigured his
face. It was like sunshine suddenly breaking through
a dark cloud.</p>

<p>But in a moment he added, sadly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“She lives? How can that be? Perhaps you are going
to tell me that she is a wretched cripple for life?” and
the anguish of his voice was heart-rending.</p>

<p>She studied his face gravely, then asked:</p>

<p>“Would that make any change in your love for her, my
brother?”</p>

<p>Trembling with emotion, his brain whirling with the
shock of joy, he answered, fervently:</p>

<p>“Change? Yes, I should love her all the dearer, my
suffering little love, because to my devotion would be
added the divine elements of pity and sympathy. Where
is she, Alva? Take me to my darling at once! Ah, now
I can live again in her life! I will be her strength and
shield. I will watch by her couch of pain, and soothe her
in her sufferings!”</p>

<p>Overcome with emotion, he leaned his face on Alva’s
shoulder, and a stifled sob burst from his lips.</p>

<p>In that moment they all realized in its greatness the
might of his love for little Floy.</p>

<p>Alva glanced around to see if Floy were coming in answer
to her message.</p>

<p>What a moment it would be when she should take the
fair young girl by the hand and lead her to St. George in
all her enchanting beauty!</p>

<p>Several moments passed, yet the door did not open.</p>

<p>Alva guessed now all the cause of Floy’s timidity, but
she wondered at the girl’s delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[169]</span></p>

<p>If she really loved St. George, why did she not hasten
to his side?</p>

<p>Lifting his head from her shoulder, he asked again,
eagerly:</p>

<p>“Where is my darling?”</p>

<p>“She is here in this house, St. George, alive, uninjured,
more beautiful than ever. I have sent for her. She will
be here in a moment.”</p>

<p>“You have planned all this to surprise me! Oh, what
a joyful moment!” he cried, with his eager eyes on the
door.</p>

<p>“No, it is you who surprised us, dear. We knew her
only as my model. How could we guess she was your
little sweetheart whose name you did not tell? And as
for her, she did not breathe her secret.”</p>

<p>“Because I bid her not,” he explained.</p>

<p>And while they waited with burning impatience for
Floy to appear, they told him all they knew of the fair
girl who had so interested his mother from the first moment
of their meeting.</p>

<p>St. George listened with breathless interest to every
word, his heart throbbing with joy, his blood bounding
through his veins with new life.</p>

<p>“If you had only written me her name, dear, all this
trouble would have been avoided, for Floy won my heart
at our first meeting, and I should not have been able to
steel my heart against the little beauty!” cried his mother.</p>

<p>“And you will welcome her as a daughter?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[170]</span></p>

<p>“Proudly,” she answered, smilingly.</p>

<p>“And you, father?”</p>

<p>Mr. Beresford laughed, and answered, blandly:</p>

<p>“My son, I have always been under petticoat government
since I married this proud lady, your mother. Her
indorsement of your choice secures my consent.”</p>

<p>How bright the future looked at that moment to them
all!</p>

<p>But the next instant Alva’s maid entered the room
with so grave a face that it instantly sobered the happy
party.</p>

<p>“Where is Miss Fane?” cried Alva, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Alva, I wish I could answer that question;
but&mdash;but I’ve been all over the house&mdash;everywhere&mdash;and
she’s not in it. And then I went back to her room and
searched more closely, and I’m afraid she has gone
away, for&mdash;I found this note for you, miss,” answered
Honora, in real distress, as she presented her mistress
with a square blue envelope addressed in Floy’s hand.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A YOUNG GIRL’S PRIDE.</span></h2>


<p>Alva took the letter from Honora amid cries of dismay
from them all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>

<p>She broke the seal, and as she opened the letter, a flashing
diamond ring fell out into her hand from the closely
written sheet.</p>

<p>“It is the ring I gave her when we became engaged,”
exclaimed St. George, taking it and kissing it in memory
of that night, his heart thrilling with the memory of her
beauty and sweetness as he kissed her good-bye beneath
the drooping vines.</p>

<p>Alva read aloud, knowing how impatient they would
be to hear the letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Beresford</span>&mdash;I have gone away because
there is a secret I can no longer keep from you, and I
know that when you learn it you will be glad I left you.</p>

<p>“‘I am the poor girl whose engagement to your brother
so bitterly outraged the Beresford pride.</p>

<p>“‘When I first came to you I was very happy, because
I fancied I might win your love, so that you would
welcome St. George’s choice.</p>

<p>“‘But when you told me his story, although you seemed
to take his part, it seemed to me that you sympathized
with your parents and feared that your brother would
be unhappy in the lot he had chosen. You said he would
be so poor he would regret that he had sacrificed fortune
for love’s sake.</p>

<p>“‘At first I did not believe it; I was resolved to cling
to my lover, and put his constancy to the test.</p>

<p>“‘When you told me that your brother’s love affair
was over, that you believed that your mother had persuaded
him the girl was unworthy, I fancied you were
glad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[172]</span></p>

<p>“‘So I knew there was no use staying on for his return.
His heart had turned from me, and he would be
sorry to find me here.</p>

<p>“‘I, too, am proud, though not a Beresford. There
may be other pride than that of wealth and place.</p>

<p>“‘I, little Floy Fane, the daughter of a most unfortunate
race, born to a heritage of sorrow, poor and alone
in life, am yet too proud to thrust myself upon a family
that despises me, yet whose equal I feel myself to be in
all but money&mdash;that mere dross to a truly noble heart.</p>

<p>“‘So I have left you forever. I am glad that I have
been of some use to you. I pity you and love you, for it
seems to me that pride has made shipwreck of your own
life. Love has no part in it, and you are not happy.</p>

<p>“‘Do not feel troubled over my fate. Thanks to your
generosity, I have money enough to support me till I find
work again.</p>

<p>“‘This ring&mdash;your brother’s gift to me in the hour
when I promised to be his wife, not knowing his family’s
pride and his own fickle heart&mdash;please return to him
with a last farewell from</p>

<p class="ir2 p-1"><span class="smcap">“‘Floy</span>.’”</p></div>

<p>The letter bore date of the evening before. She had
waited&mdash;poor little loving heart&mdash;for one sight of him,
her fickle, lost love; then she had stolen away, alone and
lonely, to begin her battle with the world again.</p>

<p>It was a cruel disappointment to them all, but they
bore it bravely, because it did not seem possible that Floy
could hide herself from them long.</p>

<p>Indeed, she had not even threatened to hide herself,
for how could she suppose they would search for her in
her exile?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>She had told herself most bitterly that they would rejoice
at her flight.</p>

<p>“Oh, the proud little darling, how cruelly she misunderstood
me!” cried Alva, tenderly. “But we will send
for Floyd Landon. He will find her for us as he did
before.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MAYBELLE WRITES A LETTER.</span></h2>


<p>They sent for the detective and confided the whole
story to him, knowing that he was both clever and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Mr. Landon was pleased when he heard that beautiful
Floy was St. George’s chosen bride, and he was confident
that he could find her again.</p>

<p>But he did not judge it expedient to keep his promise
to Floy any longer&mdash;the promise to shield Otho Maury.</p>

<p>So he said to the anxious lover:</p>

<p>“You have a dangerous rival.”</p>

<p>“You mean Otho Maury?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Floy hates the villain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he knows it. That makes him all the more
dangerous, because he is determined on revenge for her<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
scorn;” and the detective related the story of that night
when he found Floy at Suicide Place.</p>

<p>“That man will bear watching,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then watch him for me, and if he harms one hair of
my darling’s head, his life shall pay the forfeit!” cried
the angry lover.</p>

<p>It hurt him bitterly that he was not strong enough
yet to join Landon in the search for his darling; but still,
he had every confidence in the detective’s ability, so he
prepared to wait with what patience he could for tidings.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his heart was filled with a great, glad joy
at the news that she was living.</p>

<p>She was living, his beautiful darling, and she loved
him still! He knew it in his heart that she loved him
still. Such love as theirs could not change or falter from
its allegiance.</p>

<p>Their hearts had met in a love that could not change
or die.</p>

<p>It was only a little misunderstanding that had come between
them&mdash;a little misunderstanding brought about by
pride&mdash;that could easily be explained away once they met
again.</p>

<p>“And I shall scold her just a little for doubting my
faith,” he resolved, thinking that Floy’s belief in him
should have been absolute even through absence and estrangement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“And yet I know, past all doubting, truly&mdash;
</div><div class="indent1">A knowledge greater than grief can dim&mdash;

</div><div class="indent1">Yea, better&mdash;e’en better than I love him.

</div></div></div></div>

<p>Meanwhile, the very thought that Floy was alive was
like the very elixir of life to him.</p>

<p>It did him more good than all the doctors in the world,
with their pills and potions, could have accomplished.</p>

<p>“I shall get well now; I feel stronger already!” he
exclaimed, gladly.</p>

<p>Several days passed without news from the detective,
but he would not permit himself to be cast down.</p>

<p>“She will soon be found, my little love, my blue-eyed
darling! I will be patient; I will wait; for when I find
her again, we shall be parted no more, save by death itself!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>They had talked it all over, and agreed that when Floy
was found, St. George should persuade her to marry him
at once.</p>

<p>She was friendless, homeless, and the sooner she became
one of the family, the better.</p>

<p>There would be a nine-days’ wonder over the marriage,
of course. But no matter; they were prepared to risk it,
in their eagerness to make up to the young lover for all
the pangs he had suffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[176]</span></p>

<p>Alva made him welcome in the studio, where he spent
more than half his time.</p>

<p>The picture of Cupid, and the half-finished one of
Maidenhood charmed him, and beguiled the long hours of
waiting for Floy to be found.</p>

<p>He was surprised one day to receive a letter from
Maybelle Maury.</p>

<p>She knew that he had come home at last, but she did
not know that Floy had been hidden in his home all
those weeks, so she hoped that the hapless girl had
dropped out of all their lives forever. Perhaps she had
committed suicide, after all?</p>

<p>The very madness of love and longing drove Maybelle
into a most unwomanly act.</p>

<p>She fancied that by thrusting herself upon the young
man’s notice she might reawaken in his heart the tenderness
she had fancied was dawning there just before his
meeting with Floy.</p>

<p>She wrote a tender and pathetic letter, in which all her
heart was revealed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are home at last,” she wrote. “Oh, how glad I
am to know it! Need I tell you how cruelly I suffered
when I heard that you were ill far, far across the sea?
I longed for the wings of a bird to fly to you, and hover
near you all unknown. Would I have been welcome if
you had guessed I was there? Ah, St. George, once I
believed I might be all in all to you, but a cloud came between
us. It was the last day of the picnic, and I have
never understood why you left us so strangely that night,<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
with only a note of farewell. Why was it? Will you not
explain now? Was it my fault? Did I offend you in
any way? If I did, surely I have a right to ask in
what way? For surely you knew how kindly I felt
toward you. But I must not say too much. Surely you
understand the feelings you awakened in my heart.
Forgive me for writing, but I am so wretched! Otho
says you were only flirting with me, but I can not believe
it. Your dark eyes looked too earnest. But I implore
you to write. Let me know the cruel truth if you really
meant nothing by your words and looks. The certainty
of despair is better than the cruelty of suspense.</p>

<p class="ir2 p-1">“<span class="smcap">Maybelle.</span>”</p></div>

<p>She thought she had written a very crafty letter, and
that he could not have the hardihood to doom her to despair.
He would believe that Floy was lost to him forever,
and be willing to go back to the old fancy.</p>

<p>At any rate, she knew that St. George was too honorable
to betray her secret to the world. Whether he
accepted her love or not, he would never reveal to any
one that she had proffered it to him unsought.</p>

<p>He did not belong to the low type of manhood that
goes about with coat-pockets bulging with silly love letters
from silly women, reading them aloud to whoever will
listen, and boasting of his conquests among the fair sex.</p>

<p>Such a contemptible poltroon makes a high-minded
person exclaim with Shakespeare:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent10">“Oh, for a whip,
</div><div class="indent0">To lash the rascal naked through the world!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>St George was the soul of white-handed honor. He
burned Maybelle’s letter to ashes, and no soul ever heard
from him that she had stooped from her pedestal of
womanly reticence to write such words.</p>

<p>And he wrote back, courteously:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry that you have misunderstood me, but your
brother was right. I never had any serious intentions
toward you, and thought it understood on both sides that
we were engaged in a very harmless flirtation. Need I
remind you that I never sought you, and that my brief
visit at your home was as your brother’s friend, and at
his repeated solicitation?</p>

<p>“I thank you for the regard you have expressed for
me, but I hope you will withdraw it and bestow the treasure
of your love on one more able to reciprocate the
gift. It may be best for me to own that my heart is irrevocably
given elsewhere, and that I shall soon lead a bride
to the altar.”</p></div>

<p>And so with cruel kindness St. George strove to pluck
the thorn of love from Maybelle’s heart.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“For love is often a thorny flower,
</div><div class="indent1">It breaks, and we bleed and smart;
</div><div class="indent0">The blossom falls at the fairest,
</div><div class="indent1">And the thorn runs into the heart.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>The thorn had pierced deep in Maybelle’s heart, and it
almost drove her mad, that letter.</p>

<p>She sought Otho with it, and confessed the failure of
her scheme.</p>

<p>“He despises me. I can never&mdash;never win him. And<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
I think I hate him now. I would like to wound his heart
as he has wounded mine!” she groaned, in her misery.</p>

<p>“Let him go. There are others as well worth winning,”
he said, angrily.</p>

<p>“But how am I to win them?” she cried, bitterly.
“Listen, Otho: do you know that papa will surely fail
next week? The panic has ruined him, and we shall be
beggars. Mamma told me all to-day, and she said she
had hoped I would have caught a rich husband before
now. I could not tell her how hard I have tried and
failed. And how cruel it will be to be poor! I would
rather die!”</p>

<p>Otho looked at her closely. He had a pale, nervous
look, and his eyes gleamed with a sullen fire.</p>

<p>Leaning close to her, he whispered:</p>

<p>“I have a plan to get money, Maybelle. Would you be
willing to help me?”</p>

<p>“What could I do?”</p>

<p>“You would have to run a terrible risk, be sure of that.
But my nerves are strong as steel, and yours, too, are they
not?”</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;yes; I am no baby. Tell me your plan, Otho.</p>

<p>“There is no danger for us, I am sure,” he repeated reassuringly
to himself; then in low, whispered words he
told her his story.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">BUT ONE CHANCE IN A HUNDRED.</span></h2>


<p>But we must turn our attention from other interests
for awhile to follow the fortunes of our unhappy heroine,
lovely Floy.</p>

<p>How sadly her fortunes had altered since we first saw
her flashing through the streets of Mount Vernon on her
bicycle, a vision of beauty, light of heart, and careless as
a joyous little humming-bird!</p>

<p>Love and sorrow had come to her as it comes to many,
hand in hand, saddening her heart and changing her
life.</p>

<p>Her life in those weeks with Alva had been widened in
its scope. The clever and intelligent Alva had taught her
many things.</p>

<p>Bitterest of all, she had learned how wide was the gulf
of pride that yawned between her, a simple poor girl,
and the heir of the Beresfords.</p>

<p>Self-exiled in her pride and poverty, she stole away
from her luxuriant home that summer night, her blue
eyes blinded by heavy tears, her heart aching in its desolation,
yet with no thought of turning back from the conflict
that lay before her in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p>In that slender, lovely form was embodied indomitable
pride and strong self-will.</p>

<p>Her heart swelled with bitterness against St. George<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Beresford, who, after pretending to love her with such
entire devotion, could be so easily swayed from his allegiance
by another’s will.</p>

<p>“He was not worthy my love!” she cried bitterly to
her heart, as she flitted along Fifth Avenue in the glare
of the lights, but so plainly dressed and heavily veiled
that none could notice the wonderful beauty that might
have attracted unwelcome admiration.</p>

<p>As her flight from Alva’s protection had been carefully
planned ever since she had heard of St. George’s projected
return, Floy had made sure of a refuge that, though
lowly, would be safe and secure.</p>

<p>In an humble quarter of the city, not very far away
from the Beresford mansion, lived a poor woman who
made her living by lace-mending and embroidery. The
Beresford ladies frequently employed her, and Floy had
seen her a number of times during her stay with Alva.
She knew that the woman lived alone very quietly with an
aged, bed-ridden mother, and she had made private
arrangements to go and board with this humble soul for
a week until she could make arrangements for her future.</p>

<p>To this humble home Floy made her way without accident
of any kind, and was welcomed by Ruth Bascom,
the spinster lace-mender. That night the restless little
golden head was pillowed on straw instead of down, the
luxury of yesterday exchanged for the poverty of to-day.</p>

<p>She sat upon the side of the hard cot looking about her
with a bitter smile, wondering why fortune was so unequally<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
divided in this world, and if the Beresfords deserved
wealth and happiness any more than she and the
Bascoms did poverty and pain.</p>

<p>A passionate wish came to her to meet the Beresfords
on equal grounds&mdash;to be rich and grand, to wear jewels
and laces, and dance at their grand balls.</p>

<p>“They would not pity and scorn me then&mdash;they would
be glad for their son to marry me,” she thought.</p>

<p>The wish grew into a longing as the sleepless hours
wore on.</p>

<p>Visions came to her in the long, sultry night&mdash;so close
and hot in the stifling little chamber that she could not
rest&mdash;of how different life might have been if only the
wealth that had become only a tradition in the family now
had not been so strangely lost.</p>

<p>“I should be his equal now. No one would try to part
us, and&mdash;we should be so happy!” she sobbed; and the
bitter, bitter tears came in a burning shower.</p>

<p>She buried her hot face in the pillow, shuddering, for
a wild temptation had come to her&mdash;one from which she
shrunk in terror.</p>

<p>She murmured, faintly:</p>

<p>“It is a terrible risk; but what matter? Life is not so
sweet that one should greatly prize it, even if goaded to
throw it away!”</p>

<p>But she hid her face in her hands, and her slight frame
shook as with a mortal chill.</p>

<p>A vision had swept over her of the day when she had<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
found her beautiful mother cold and dead&mdash;dead by her
own hand&mdash;and how she, a weeping child, had been taken
to the hearts of the good, kind old couple who had loved
her so dearly.</p>

<p>“If I died, there would be none to weep for me&mdash;none
but dear Mrs. Banks,” she thought, piteously;
and the terrible temptation to risk life for the sake of
sordid gold overpowered the poor girl who had never
realized till now the worldly value of the hard, yellow,
shining metal.</p>

<p>A yearning to be rich and grand like the Beresfords, to
meet them on equal grounds, to give them scorn for
scorn, to flaunt before their eyes the devotion of other
lovers, overpowered the unhappy girl, who knew that
there was one chance in a hundred of realizing these
radiant dreams&mdash;one chance which she vowed to strive
for despite the grim records of sixty years of her ill-fated
race.</p>

<p>It was August now, and ten years had passed since
a victim had been immolated on the grim altar of the
Moloch of Suicide Place. Would it claim another sacrifice,
this insatiable monster? But a few months of
the fatal year remained.</p>

<p>“Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make
mad.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“HOPE DEFERRED MAKETH THE HEART SICK.”</span></h2>


<p>Ah, how slowly pass the days and weeks when parted
from one we love!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Oh, absence is the night of love,
</div><div class="indent1">Lovers are very children then,
</div><div class="indent0">Fancy ten thousand feverish ills
</div><div class="indent1">Till their loved one returns again!”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Beresford knew all the meaning of the poet’s plaint
as the slow days and nights dragged their weary lengths
along without tidings of Floy.</p>

<p>For, though a week had passed away, Landon had no
encouraging news to give.</p>

<p>The suspense began to tell on the weakened nerves
of the impatient lover, and his improvement became less
marked as hope and expectation became dulled in his
heart.</p>

<p>But in vain they urged him to desert the hot city for
the cool breezes of Newport.</p>

<p>“It would seem like deserting my darling. I can not
go until I find her,” he answered, resolutely; and so the
burning August days found them lingering still in the
city, though the aristocratic avenue was deserted save for
them. They would not leave him there to fret and
grieve alone over his trouble.</p>

<p>He was bitterly impatient over his lingering weakness<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
that prevented him from taking an active part in the
search for Floy.</p>

<p>“Be patient, dear; Mr. Landon will surely find her
soon!” Alva would exclaim each day, her own heart
aching in sympathy with his pain.</p>

<p>She brought from Floy’s room, for his eyes to feast
on, the books the young girl had read and marked, and
it was a melancholy joy to him to read every line her
dear eyes had rested on or her pencil marked. It seemed
to bring their sundered hearts closer together.</p>

<p>One day she chanced on a little blank-book in which
Floy had been wont to scribble her girlish fancies when
alone, and she found that many of her sweet thoughts had
been clothed in poetic diction.</p>

<p>Poetry is the natural language of love, and Floy, in her
sorrow, had fallen so often into this tender speech, that
Alva’s tears fell like rain as she read the simple lines.</p>

<p>There was one little poem that bore date the very day
of St. George’s home-coming, so she could not doubt
that it was written for her brother.</p>

<p>“Who would have dreamed that bright, arch little
Floy had such depths of womanly tenderness in her nature?”
she exclaimed, when telling St. George about the
sweet little verses.</p>

<p>“You will let me see them!” he cried, eagerly; and
Alva assented, saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, for I am sure they were composed by Floy herself,
and intended for you, my dear. They are very<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
simple and sad, and perhaps have but little literary merit,
yet they breathe the love and constancy of a noble
heart.”</p>

<p>She gave him the little book to read, and he turned
the pages as though they were something sacred, for here
and there they were blistered with Floy’s sad tears.</p>

<p>The letter that Floy had left for Alva had told but little
of her love, and breathed only her indomitable pride.
How different was the little book that in her hurry she
had forgotten to take away!</p>

<p>Every tender word found an echo in St. George’s devoted
heart, and when he came to the page that bore
date of his home-coming, he was not ashamed of the
tears that rose when he read the sad and tender lines
so full of her love and sorrow and tenderness.</p>

<p>St. George read the sad words over and over till they
were imprinted on his memory. They had the greatest
fascination for him in their hopeless love and sorrow.</p>

<p>He tried to write some verses in reply to them, but
after many efforts he was chagrined to find that he did
not possess the least poetic faculty. He could rhyme
“love” with “dove” to be sure, but the lines were
not even.</p>

<p>He threw aside the pencil, crying, tenderly:</p>

<p>“Oh, my little love, how cruelly you have misunderstood
me! But only let me find you again, bonnie
Floy, and I will show you that I, too, can love with
changeless constancy.”</p>

<p>But oh, how far away that blessed time seemed; for
Floyd Landon failed to find any clew to the beautiful
runaway, and at last he appeared at the house saying
rather abruptly that he wished to give up the case.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“THE HOUSE IS HAUNTED.”</span></h2>


<p>Beresford could find no words in which to express
his surprise and chagrin.</p>

<p>He could only stare, speechlessly, at the detective
waiting for an explanation.</p>

<p>He saw that Landon looked pale and nervous.</p>

<p>“You are ill!” he exclaimed, at last, as if that explained
all.</p>

<p>“No, I am not ill, but&mdash;I&mdash;have had&mdash;a great shock&mdash;so
that I can not bring myself to go on with the search
for Miss Fane. You must employ some one else.”</p>

<p>“But who can succeed where you have failed, Landon?
You, the bravest, cleverest detective in New York!”</p>

<p>The detective smiled, as if gratified at this praise, then
sighed:</p>

<p>“You would not call me brave if you knew all. You
could hardly credit it, that a New York detective, in
this prosaic nineteenth century, could feel a fear of&mdash;the
supernatural!”</p>

<p>He paled and shuddered as at some ghastly recollection,
then continued:</p>

<p>“I am coward, I confess it, Mr. Beresford. I that
never flinched at the sight of danger in mortal shape,
have struck my colors and fled from&mdash;ghosts!”</p>

<p>“Explain!” cried the young man, anxiously; then<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
seeing the extreme pallor of his visitor, hastily rang for
wine. “Drink; you will feel better,” he said.</p>

<p>Landon gulped down half a glass, and the color returned
to his pallid face, as he said:</p>

<p>“I have been searching Suicide Place again for Miss
Fane.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” eagerly.</p>

<p>“I have not found the missing girl, Mr. Beresford,
but I have learned that the gossips of Mount Vernon
told the truth when they declared that Suicide Place is
haunted by evil spirits!”</p>

<p>Every word dropped separately with awful emphasis,
and Landon’s face, white and solemn, with deep, troubled
eyes, attested his implicit faith in his own declaration.</p>

<p>Beresford was too shocked to reply. He waited
mutely for more.</p>

<p>Landon drained his glass, and continued:</p>

<p>“When I had searched New York vainly for a week,
I concluded that Miss Fane had perhaps ventured back
to Suicide Place. I went down there three days ago.
The very first night I made a startling discovery.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I found that Otho Maury and his eldest sister, the
beautiful Maybelle, were in the habit of spending the
wee small hours of each night secretly within the portals
of Suicide Place.”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! for what sinister purpose, Landon?”</p>

<p>“It occurred to me that they had somehow imprisoned<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
Miss Fane in the house, and were keeping her there
to force her consent to a marriage with Otho, who is
madly in love with the little beauty.”</p>

<p>“It is very probable. But you&mdash;you found out&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>As that strange word dropped from the detective’s
lips, Beresford glared at him as if he would spring at his
throat.</p>

<p>“You&mdash;you dared to come away and leave her to their
mercy, you coward!” he groaned.</p>

<p>Landon paled and shuddered, but he fronted the other’s
wrath fearlessly, answering quietly:</p>

<p>“I am not angry at your harsh epithets, for&mdash;my
God! how can you understand?”</p>

<p>“Explain then before I leave this house to go to her
assistance!” thundered Beresford, in deadly anger, overcome
by the thought of Floy in the power of her relentless
enemies.</p>

<p>What would they do to her, his hapless darling?
Would they kill her, or, perhaps, more terrible still, force
her into an abhorred marriage with Otho Maury?</p>

<p>His senses whirled with his misery, and he was on the
verge of falling, when Landon caught him, pushing him
back into his seat.</p>

<p>“Listen to me one moment,” he cried, and continued:
“I have done that any man could do, but I have failed
to follow the wretches to their lair. In that grim old
house there is some malign influence that drives the<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
bravest man back to the threshold half mad with horror.
What is it? It is haunted; that is why! No, I have
seen nothing, but&mdash;the spirits of the damned haunt that
house as surely as we two live and breathe. If you
could hear them, Mr. Beresford, those sounds of woe
that echo through the long corridors and empty rooms,
that fiend’s laugh that chills your blood like ice, and
drives you back, shuddering from the threshold, out into
the cool darkness of the summer night so sweet and peaceful,
you would no longer cry out coward; you, too, would
turn and fly.”</p>

<p>“Not I, Landon; not I. All the hordes of hell assembled
could not frighten me back from my darling in
peril!”</p>

<p>“You think so. Let me tell you what I have seen.
I have watched them go in before me, Otho and his sister,
and as I retreated they would rush past me in terror
great as mine. I have seen her three nights fall swooning
on the wet grass. He would revive her, coax her, and
hand in hand, encouraging each other, they would re-enter,
perhaps overcoming their fears, and remain for
hours, always leaving before daylight and skulking home
unseen. Braver than I, you say? Yes, but they were
two, I was only one. At last I could bear it no longer; I
came away. I ask no recompense; I resign the terrible
quest.”</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“LIFE IS SO SAD!” CRIED FLOY.</span></h2>


<p>Floyd Landon’s nerves were so shaken by his experiences
at Suicide Place, that no entreaties could induce
him to go on with the search for Floy.</p>

<p>His usual clear head and steady nerves had apparently
deserted him. The truth was, that he was on the verge
of a severe illness that seized on him that night and
prostrated him for several weeks.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the impatient lover confided all to
his family, and announced his immediate departure for
Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>“I shall take a posse of men and explore the old house
by daylight. Not a nook or cranny shall escape me, and
if my darling is hidden there, she will be found. Indeed,
I can not understand why Mr. Landon did not do
this,” he concluded, with feverish impatience.</p>

<p>“I can not let you go alone. I will accompany you!”
exclaimed Alva, eagerly; and the offer was eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>They started for Mount Vernon within the hour, and
on arriving went at once to a hotel.</p>

<p>What was Beresford’s astonishment to meet there a
person whom, in the agitation of his troubles, he had
almost forgotten&mdash;his interesting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compagnon du voyage</i>&mdash;Lord
Alexander Miller!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>The nobleman’s fair, handsome face had acquired a
deeper cast of pensiveness than before. His splendid blue
eyes were grave and sad, but they kindled with admiration
when they rested on the brilliant beauty of Alva as
St. George presented him to his sister.</p>

<p>When he saw St. George’s start of surprise, he smiled
and said:</p>

<p>“I see you had almost forgotten me, Mr. Beresford.”</p>

<p>“Not so; but I was not expecting to meet you here&mdash;although
I remember now you told me when we parted
that you were coming to Mount Vernon.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I have been here ever since, and am just now
leaving. In fact, my cab is waiting for me at the door.”</p>

<p>“Shall we not meet you in New York on our return?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so. I have not forgotten your invitation,
but I have felt too depressed to leave here before. The
truth is, I came here expecting to see some dear&mdash;friends.
But I have had a great shock. I found them dead.”</p>

<p>There was a note of pain in his voice, and Alva’s heart
throbbed with a strange sympathy, he seemed so grave,
so sad.</p>

<p>He resumed, after a moment, wearily:</p>

<p>“I feel so unsettled, I scarcely know what to do. My
first impulse was to return to England, but I have been
lingering on here till now, so I suppose I shall do America
before I go home. My present plan is to go to Newport
at the pressing invitation of some Americans I met
last spring in London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>“We, too, go to Newport as soon as my business here
is concluded; so we may meet again soon,” exclaimed St.
George, with real pleasure.</p>

<p>“I am glad of that&mdash;so it is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au revoir</i>, and not good-bye,”
smiled the Englishman, lifting his hat in farewell
ere he turned and descended the steps to the waiting carriage.</p>

<p>Alva’s eyes followed him with frank pleasure&mdash;not
only that he was the handsomest man she had ever seen,
but because something about him recalled to her the
loved and lost one of her girlhood’s dreams.</p>

<p>“How like, how strangely like!” she thought, with
silent pain.</p>

<p>And somehow her thoughts followed him on his way
with a kindly interest just for the sake of the frank
blue eyes that had looked at her gently like the eyes
of her dead lover&mdash;dead, but not forgotten.</p>

<p>And as Alva’s thoughts followed him with a strange
interest, so did the handsome Englishman’s fancy return
to her during his brief journey to New York, dwelling
with pleasure on her beauty.</p>

<p>“What a magnificent creature! The most beautiful
American I ever saw! There was soul in those large
dark eyes&mdash;soul and feeling as of one who has suffered!
But what sorrow could come to the beautiful heiress, Miss
Beresford?” he wondered, with deep sympathy, resolving
that he would be very certain to accept her brother’s
invitation, for the sake of seeing her again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>

<p>She was still in his thoughts, and his blue eyes had a
dreamy look as he left the train and sought a carriage
to convey him to a hotel.</p>

<p>It was late afternoon, and the great city was a Babel
of noise and confusion.</p>

<p>Shaking off the spell thrown over him by Alva’s charms,
he leaned from the window of the carriage, watching the
unfamiliar scene with curious eyes.</p>

<p>The next moment he became the witness of an accident
that thrilled him with alarm.</p>

<p>A beautiful young girl, who had attempted to cross the
street, had been knocked down by a reckless bicyclist, who,
with shameless indifference to what he had done, hurried
on his way ere he could be arrested.</p>

<p>The girl, who was carrying a small traveling-bag, as
though on her way to the station, lay helpless where she
had fallen, the blood trickling down her face from a
cut on her white temple.</p>

<p>In a moment the Englishman had stopped the carriage.
He sprung out and caught up the unconscious girl from
her perilous position in the middle of the street in the
surge of hurrying vehicles, and carried her to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>A knot of people gathered around, gazing in pity and
admiration at the lovely face in its frame of rippling
golden hair.</p>

<p>A compassionate woman took some water and bathed
the blood from the wounded temple, exclaiming, angrily:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>“It is a shame that that rude fellow was not arrested
for running down this sweet girl! She might have been
killed!”</p>

<p>She bound a soft white handkerchief about the wound,
and continued:</p>

<p>“Does anybody know her? She ought to be taken
home or to the hospital. Oh! so you are coming to,
miss?”</p>

<p>The girl had indeed opened two large blue, wondering
eyes upon the anxious group that surrounded her.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt much?” inquired the kind though loquacious
woman, helping Floy&mdash;for it was our little
heroine&mdash;in her efforts to rise.</p>

<p>Floy was now on her feet, but ghastly pale and trembling.</p>

<p>She answered, faintly:</p>

<p>“No, no; only my head. But I feel very weak. I&mdash;I
must sit down a minute.”</p>

<p>“Drink this,” said some one, proffering a glass of
water.</p>

<p>She looked up into the face of a fair, handsome man,
and felt a thrill of subtle pleasure at his gaze.</p>

<p>When she had drained the glass, he added, kindly:</p>

<p>“My carriage is here; permit me to take you to your
destination.”</p>

<p>Floy knew that it was not safe to trust strangers usually;
but the voice and face of this one were so noble<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
they inspired instant confidence, so she answered,
gratefully:</p>

<p>“I will thank you very much,” and, with a grateful
smile at the woman, she followed him to the carriage,
saying: “I was on my way to the station, to go away;
but I feel so shaken that I had better postpone my trip
till to-morrow;” and she named the address of Ruth
Bascom, with whom she had been staying while she
rallied her courage to return to Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>It was a long distance, and a sudden mutual attraction
between them made the pair very confidential.</p>

<p>“I am so thankful your injuries are so slight. You
might have been killed,” he began; and the girl answered,
sadly enough:</p>

<p>“It would not have mattered much; life is so sad.”</p>

<p>“Sad? For one so young, and&mdash;pardon me&mdash;so
lovely?” exclaimed her new friend, in surprise.</p>

<p>Floy answered, out of the bitterness of her sad heart:</p>

<p>“I am only a poor orphan, sir, with no relatives and
but few friends. To such a one life offers little happiness.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” assented the nobleman, with keen sympathy;
and a great wave of tenderness swept over him
for the lovely, hapless child of misfortune.</p>

<p>He looked at her simple dress, and guessed that she was
poor as well as orphaned.</p>

<p>He, too, was almost alone in life; but he was rich, so he<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>
had many friends. We can always count our friends
when we are rich.</p>

<p>She seemed little more than a child to this man of forty
years, and he felt as if he would like to draw the golden
head against his shoulder and tell her she should be
his child, his dear adopted little daughter, if she would,
and that poverty and sorrow, those grim twins, should
never come near her any more.</p>

<p>But he feared to startle her by an abrupt avowal of his
benevolent desire, lest he should arouse distrust in her
girlish mind, she looked so timid and innocent as she sat
there by his side, so he decided not to speak to her abruptly
of his wish.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">A STRANGE ROMANCE.</span></h2>


<p>He said, with a long-drawn sigh:</p>

<p>“Life is sad to many, my dear little girl, and perhaps <a id="Ref_198"></a>I
have had as sad an experience as any.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with questioning eyes, and, although
he was usually very quiet and reserved, after the English
nature, the lovely face drew him so strangely to her that
he continued:</p>

<p>“Suppose we compare notes. I will tell you what a<span class="pagenum">[199]</span>
great sorrow I have had in my life, and then you may tell
me your story.”</p>

<p>Floy did not reply, and he saw her rosy under lip quiver
as if she repressed a sob with difficulty.</p>

<p>She was thinking with pride and pain:</p>

<p>“I can never tell this kind and noble gentleman the
story of my blighted love-dream. I do not believe that
he could understand a nature so ignoble, so fickle as that
of the handsome lover I trusted so fondly, and who failed
me so cruelly in the end. His name shall never pass my
lips either in praise or blame, although I never can forget
him.”</p>

<p>Her new friend continued in a clear, low voice, just
audible above the rumble of their carriage-wheels on the
stony street:</p>

<p>“But I have not told you who I am yet, so perhaps I
had better introduce myself. My name is Miller. I am
an Englishman, and but a few months ago inherited a title
and large estate from my father, who was a peer of the
realm.”</p>

<p>“You are great and rich!” exclaimed Floy; and he
caught a note of disappointment in her voice, and wondered
at it.</p>

<p>He continued his story by saying:</p>

<p>“Wealth and position do not always bring happiness.
They stood in the way of mine.”</p>

<p>“And of mine,” thought Floy, in silent sympathy, while
he went on:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>“Eighteen years ago&mdash;ah, me! how long it seems!&mdash;I
was the heir apparent to my father, a powerful noble, and
a member of parliament. I was his only son, and all his
hopes centered in me. My mother was dead, and I used
to spend much of my time with a favorite aunt in London,
who had two charming children. I met there a beautiful
American girl recently orphaned, who was employed as a
governess. We loved at first sight.”</p>

<p>“It is a great pity for the rich and poor to fall in love
with each other. It can not end happy!” cried Floy, out
of the bitterness of her own experience.</p>

<p>“How cynically you speak! Has the world already
made you so wise?” exclaimed Lord Miller, in surprise;
but Floy blushed without replying, unwilling to betray
herself further.</p>

<p>And again he took up the thread of his story:</p>

<p>“I see that you understand what a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mésalliance</i> it would
be considered for the heir to a title to marry a poor
governess, though she was pure as an angel and beautiful
as a princess. I knew it all too well, but love would not
listen to reason. I won her promise to be mine, and then,
hopeless of gaining my father’s consent to be married,
persuaded my darling to elope with me. Her consent was
hardly won, but she became my bride at a little English
church, and we went to live in a pretty cottage home
pending my forgiveness by my father. Alas! it was never
to be won. My father cursed me, and drove me from his
presence, swearing that I should never have a penny<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
from him, and that I should live on the beggarly two hundred
a year that I inherited as a legacy from my mother.
My aunt was also obdurate, and would have nothing to do
with us. In fact, we got the cold shoulder from all our
former friends.”</p>

<p>“The rich are as cruel as death!” murmured Floy.</p>

<p>“Not all of them, dear child, as I shall convince you
by and by,” returned Lord Miller, wondering what cruel
experience had made her so harsh and bitter, and resolving
that she should be his adopted child if she would
consent.</p>

<p>She looked up at him with admiring blue eyes, and
added:</p>

<p>“I am glad that you were brave enough to marry your
love, in spite of the opposition of your rich relations.
Not many a young man would be so brave and true.”</p>

<p>He said to himself, shrewdly:</p>

<p>“This lovely child has had a romance in her life already.
The pain of an aching heart throbs through her
bitter little speeches. Her pride has been wounded by
some vulgar rich person, no doubt.”</p>

<p>And he looked tenderly at the little beauty, while he
said:</p>

<p>“There are plenty of young men who would marry the
girl they love in spite of the whole world. I am glad I
was one of them, and I had two years of almost perfect
happiness with my darling&mdash;two years in which a lovely
little daughter came to us&mdash;a girl who would be about<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
as old as you, my child, if she had lived. Alas! she is
dead&mdash;she and her mother!”</p>

<p>His voice trembled, his face grew pale, she read keen
despair in his dark-blue eyes.</p>

<p>“I must hasten with my story,” he cried, mournfully.
“I have told you I was happy with her only two years.
Well, at the end of that time my father sent for me to
come down to one of his estates in the country&mdash;a dreary
place in Cornwall that we seldom visited, and that was
half a ruin. We thought&mdash;my wife and I&mdash;that he
meant to forgive us at last, and I went joyfully, for I did
not know he had a heart of stone.</p>

<p>“I met him at that grim old pile of ruins, and he tried to
bribe me to divorce my darling wife and desert my child.
When I refused indignantly, he&mdash;can you imagine anything
so horrible?&mdash;made his minions thrust me into a
dungeon of the old castle, and swore to me I should die
there unless I consented to his plan.</p>

<p>“I steadily refused, and I remained his prisoner almost
fifteen years, while he gave it out to the world that I had
wearied of my American wife and gone to travel in far
countries.</p>

<p>“Is it not a wonder that my heart did not break in
those cruel years? At last Heaven took pity on my tears
and prayers, and stretched my inhuman parent on a bed
of death. Then he had me brought to his bedside, and
implored my pardon for what he had done, after confessing
that my poor wife, believing his diabolical tale<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
that I had deserted her, had eked out a toilsome existence
for herself and babe in London for a few years, then
returned to her native land, and he knew not what had
been her fate thereafter.</p>

<p>“How could I forgive him his cruel work? I fell in a
swoon by his bedside, and before I revived he died, and
went to meet the judgment of the wicked. Then I set
about finding my darlings. I wrote to her old home in
Mount Vernon, New York, and received no reply. I
searched London over for months, and with no success,
so I determined to come to America. I went to my wife’s
ancestral home, Nellest Farm, and found it was deserted.
I made inquiries, and learned that my wife, Mrs. Fane, as
she called herself, had died the terrible death of the
suicide ten years before&mdash;that my daughter Florence was
taken care of by some kindly neighbor who only lately
met death by a terrible accident!”</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no; I am your daughter Florence, dearest
father!” cried Floy, in joyous excitement.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">“SOMETHING TERRIBLE!”</span></h2>


<p>Leaving Floy to explain matters to her new-found
father, we must return to Mount Vernon and follow our
hero in his search for his missing love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>At his hotel, which was located within a square of the
Maury mansion, he found that the all-absorbing subject
of conversation was of the disasters that had befallen
the Maury family within the last twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The great importing house of Maury &amp; Co. had failed
yesterday, and the head of the house had fallen dead of
a stroke of apoplexy.</p>

<p>And following on this calamity to the devoted wife
and family was the mysterious disappearance of Otho
and Maybelle.</p>

<p>Last evening they had retired early to their rooms,
seemingly prostrated with grief over the death of their
kind, indulgent parent.</p>

<p>This morning they were missing, and no clew to them
could be found.</p>

<p>When St. George Beresford heard this news his heart
sunk within him in prophetic dread.</p>

<p>Knowing what he did of Otho and Maybelle’s nocturnal
wanderings at Suicide Place, he could come to but
one conclusion.</p>

<p>Floy was their prisoner, as Landon had suspected, and
fearing detection, they had spirited her away to another
place.</p>

<p>“We have come too late!” he cried, bursting into
Alva’s presence in a quiver of emotion, and falling wearily
into a chair.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;no; you must not tell me so,” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
with keen regret; and then he poured out the whole
story.</p>

<p>Alva saw the situation in all its terror. She did not
know what to say to her brother, but she saw that she
must offer him some comfort to save him from utter
despair.</p>

<p>He had grown frightfully pale, and the despair in his
beautiful eyes made her heart ache.</p>

<p>It seemed to her as if his very life was bound up in his
sweetheart Floy&mdash;as if the failure to find her would
surely break his heart.</p>

<p>She could not permit him to give up hope, although
she herself had almost lost heart.</p>

<p>“You must not lose heart like this. That old house
must be searched!” she cried, with such cheerful eagerness
that he was inspired with fresh courage.</p>

<p>“Then I will go at once!” he cried, starting up.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” agreed Alva; and within an
hour they were on their way, Alva choosing to accompany
him, because she wished to be on the spot to solace
his sorrow if he failed to find Floy.</p>

<p>She was determined to do all she could for him, openly
blaming herself for the flight of the girl.</p>

<p>“It was my idle chatter to her that made her lose
faith in him and run away, so I must do what I can to
atone,” she said.</p>

<p>At the very last they decided to go alone.</p>

<p>St. George remembered the gruesome character of<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
Suicide Place, and how he had heard that no one could
be persuaded to go there for love or money.</p>

<p>Besides, he shrunk from creating a useless sensation,
for he had little hope now of finding his darling there.</p>

<p>“You know all the terrible things that Landon told
me. Are you willing to risk the horrors of the place?” he
asked Alva, anxiously.</p>

<p>Alva was a magnificent woman, in high health and
with strong nerves. She laughed at her brother’s question.</p>

<p>“I am not at all afraid that the ghosts will rout <em>me</em>!”
she replied, gayly.</p>

<p>So they ordered a carriage to take them out, and the
driver was almost petrified with astonishment when they
told him to drive past Suicide Place.</p>

<p>It was nearing sunset when they reached the grim
old building in its splendid grove of trees, and again the
driver gasped with amazement when told to stop there.</p>

<p>“We are going to walk through that splendid grove,”
explained Alva, carelessly.</p>

<p>“But, begging your pardon, miss, surely you don’t
know what an awful name the place bears. I wouldn’t
set foot inside that gate for a thousand dollars, poor as
I am!” cried the man, in consternation.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I <em>do</em> know all about the place, but I don’t
believe those spook tales, and my brother and I are determined
to explore those grounds so that we can boast
of our bravery hereafter. So you may wait for us here,”<span class="pagenum">[207]</span>
laughed Alva; and she was vastly amused when she saw
the disgusted man drive off to the opposite side of the
road so as to be as far as possible from the place.</p>

<p>But as she went in through the gates, out of the glory
of the August sunlight that flooded the west, into the
heavy shallows of the dark grove, the smile faded from
Alva’s ruby lips, and a subtle premonition of evil began
to weigh on her spirits.</p>

<p>As for St. George, he was remembering the first time
he came here&mdash;that May night that seemed so long ago
now, when he had followed Floy, warned of her peril by
that strange dream, and saved her from the insults of
Otho Maury.</p>

<p>How freshly it all came back&mdash;the sweet May night
cool with soft spring rain, the breeze laden with odors of
wet lilacs tossing their purple plumes against the windows.</p>

<p>How sweet she had been! how grateful, bonnie little
Floy! He remembered, as if it were last night, their ride
home, and how they had parted at the door betrothed
lovers! He could still feel that sweet, dewy kiss on his
lips in all its divine bliss, and he stifled a bitter groan as
he remembered all that had come and gone since then,
parting them so cruelly from each other.</p>

<p>He felt Alva shudder as she clung to his arm, and looking
down at her face, saw that it was pale and grave, with
somber eyes.</p>

<p>“Alva, you are ill, or frightened!” he cried, anxiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>“No, no; go on!” she answered, urging him on, and
trying to shake off her strange depression.</p>

<p>The spell fell over St. George, too, and icy fingers
seemed to clutch at his heart. He muttered, in a strange
voice:</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I am not a coward, Alva; I do not wish to turn
back; but I have a feeling that we are going to confront&mdash;something
terrible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but&mdash;go on!” she whispered back, with
white lips.</p>

<p>They moved slowly, arm in arm, around the winding
walk toward the side of the house, as St. George had
gone that first night, toward the side door.</p>

<p>Everything was so still they could hear the beating
of their own hearts.</p>

<p>“The door stands ajar. Perhaps I had better go in
alone. You are nervous, Alva,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Not at all; but the place has a depressing influence&mdash;doubtless
from the stories told of it,” she murmured,
clinging to him, and, indeed, putting her foot first upon
the threshold.</p>

<p>They went mutely along the gloomy hall, expecting to
hear the silence broken by those awful demoniac shrieks
of which Landon had told. But all was still&mdash;awfully
still.</p>

<p>Close to them a door swung wide open. They stopped,
and looked with curious eyes at <em>what</em> lay beyond the
threshold&mdash;two bodies, white and cold in death, lying side<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
by side in a pool of clotted blood that showed dark in
the sunset light streaming through the open window.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THE LAST VICTIM.</span></h2>


<p>It was no wonder that the fiends’ laugh echoed no
longer through the dark, grim halls of Suicide Place,
since its awful Moloch had claimed the sacrifice of the
sixth decade.</p>

<p>Beresford and his sister stood as if turned to stone
upon the threshold, gazing in upon that awful sight, on
which the sun’s last rays flickered dismally, as if in pity.</p>

<p>No wonder Otho and Maybelle had not returned last
night! No wonder their disappearance remained so deep
a mystery! They lay here dead in that awful house
where scarcely a human foot dared penetrate.</p>

<p>Otho’s stiffened hand lay along the carpet, still grasping
the weapon with which he had sent a bullet through
his heart.</p>

<p>His handsome features, white as marble by contrast
with his jetty hair and mustache, showed ghastly now,
with the fallen lower jaw and the half-open dark eyes,
that held frozen in their unseeing upward gaze an expression<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
of hate, as if they had looked last on some abhorred
sight.</p>

<p>It was a tragedy to shake the strongest nerves, and
they turned with relief toward Maybelle, who looked
more natural, her eyes and lips closed, only her stillness
and corpse-like pallor betraying that death was there.
Above her heart was a clot of dried blood that had
flowed from a dagger-thrust given by her own hand, for
just beneath her touch lay the shining steel.</p>

<p>Alva and St. George contemplated the awful sight in
horror too deep for words. With their arms about each
other, they gazed and gazed, shuddering and trembling
with pity, for their generous hearts forgot the wrong-doing
of the pair in sympathy for the strange fate that
had overtaken them.</p>

<p>At last rousing himself to the exigencies of the moment,
Beresford sighed heavily and said:</p>

<p>“We must go and tell the driver of this awful discovery,
and send him back to Mount Vernon with the news.”</p>

<p>They went to the driver, who was so astounded he
could hardly credit the story.</p>

<p>Curiosity conquered his dread of Suicide Place for
once, and he followed them into the gloomy portals to
gaze with awe on the sickening sight of the two suicides,
then willingly agreed to drive back into town to
spread the news and summon the coroner.</p>

<p>Alva insisted on remaining with her brother.</p>

<p>“We have not found Floy yet, you know,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[211]</span></p>

<p>“Shall we resume our search?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It would be better than remaining in this room,” she
shuddered, and was turning away, when her pitying gaze,
that had rested on Maybelle’s ghastly face, suddenly returned
to it in amazement.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;look!” she cried, wildly. “Her eyelids
moved! See, her breast heaves! She is not dead! She
revives!”</p>

<p>St. George turned back at his sister’s words and saw
that they were true.</p>

<p>Maybelle was reviving.</p>

<p>Her dark eyes opened wide and rested imploringly on
their faces.</p>

<p>“Do not leave me!” she faltered.</p>

<p>They hurried to her side, and Alva lifted the heavy
head on her arm while Beresford poured a few drops of
wine between her lips from a flask he had brought with
other restoratives in a tiny case.</p>

<p>Maybelle moaned faintly:</p>

<p>“Poor Otho, he is quite dead, is he not? His courage
did not fail&mdash;like mine&mdash;at the last.”</p>

<p>Beresford drew a shawl over the dead face reverently,
hiding it from her sight, and she added:</p>

<p>“When the cold steel pierced my flesh it pained me so
I could not drive it home to my heart. It fell from my
hand and I fainted. But&mdash;but&mdash;I shall die all the same,
shall I not?” anxiously.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">“JUST ONE KISS!”</span></h2>


<p>“Oh, we hope not!” they answered, soothingly, and
raised her gently, placing her on a soft couch by the window,
where the summer breeze could caress her pale
brow.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I have prayed and prayed for some one to
come,” she continued. “Ever since midnight I have lain
here fainting and reviving, fainting and reviving, too
weak to rise, and longing for water to cool my parched
throat. Oh, thank you, thank you, how sweet and cool
it is! Oh, what a wretched day! When I heard your
steps and voices coming, I fainted from pure joy!”</p>

<p>She did not seem surprised at their coming. Perhaps
she guessed in some way at the reason.</p>

<p>Beresford stooped over her with anguish in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I must ask you one question,” he cried, “and as you
hope for Heaven, if you die, I implore you, answer it
truly. Is Florence Fane in this house?”</p>

<p>“She is not. That is true,” answered Maybelle, growing
paler at this reminder of her successful rival.</p>

<p>“Where is she, then? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“I swear I do not know,” she replied, faintly, and he
read truth in her beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>She was strangely beautiful in her pallor and pain, and
Alva thought for a moment how strange it was that her<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
brother had not loved charming Maybelle before he met
Floy.</p>

<p>But in the next moment she sighed to herself:</p>

<p>“There is no accounting for Love’s vagaries. I am
glad my brother loved little Floy instead of imperious
Maybelle.”</p>

<p>Beresford looked at the poor girl with pitying eyes.
The knowledge of her hopeless love for himself softened
his heart, and he said, gently:</p>

<p>“Why did you attempt this terrible deed? What malign
influence drove you to self-murder?”</p>

<p>She shuddered and closed her eyes. He thought she
was going to faint again, and reproached himself for tormenting
her by such questions.</p>

<p>But Maybelle opened her eyes again, and said, solemnly:</p>

<p>“I will tell you the grim secret of Suicide Place, for
perhaps I am dying, and the story should be known, and
the old building torn down to set at rest an unquiet spirit.
Floy knows it all, I am sure, but I do not think she
would ever tell.”</p>

<p>“You may exhaust yourself,” he objected, though his
curiosity was on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>.</p>

<p>“No; I shall not talk more than is necessary.” She
swallowed some more wine held to her lips by his hand,
and began: “Perhaps you have heard that the owners of
this property&mdash;Floy’s ancestors&mdash;were very rich long
ago?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard of old Jasper Nellest who was so
miserly, and yet died poor, and left his descendants nothing
but this property that seemed afterward to be banned
by a curse,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Yes, that is the gist of the story,” answered Maybelle,
sighing. “That old man died rich, but he had
turned all he owned into yellow, shining, golden coin.
But he did not mean to cheat his heirs of their inheritance,
only he died suddenly before he could tell them
where the treasure was hidden. Well, his punishment
is to haunt his old home, vainly trying to reveal the secret
he carried to the grave.”</p>

<p>“Can this be true?” cried Alva in wonder.</p>

<p>“It is true,” answered Maybelle. “I have seen him
again and again, and it is horrible!”</p>

<p>She paused and glanced half fearfully at the door,
muttering:</p>

<p>“But, no, no&mdash;he will be shocked at the evil he has
wrought, he will not venture back for long, long years.
It has always been so, they say.”</p>

<p>They listened eagerly, devouring every word, wondering
if her strange story could be true.</p>

<p>“You doubt me!” cried Maybelle, reading their faces.
“Well, I am too weak to waste words trying to convince
you. I can only tell what I know in the briefest fashion.”</p>

<p>She rested a little while, then resumed her story:</p>

<p>“This old man&mdash;this miser&mdash;has surely hidden his gold
somewhere in this house, but he has not the power of<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
speech, only of strange, demoniacal laughter. It is this
way: Some night in wandering through the long corridor&mdash;always
the long corridor&mdash;you come upon an old
man chuckling, gibbering to himself. You stop, you stare
in terror, and he spreads abroad his lean hands. You
see grouped about him, as in a golden haze, open chests
of golden coin&mdash;think of it, <em>great chests of gold!</em>&mdash;and
the sight fires you with a mad longing to possess the
treasure whose existence you thus discover. You gaze
spell-bound, but the hideous old miser begins to laugh
with hideous mirth, gloating over his wealth, till you fly
in deadly terror from the scene. But, alas! only to return,
goaded by an awful desire to search the old place
over for the missing gold. You search in vain, and the
old miser seems to gloat over your failures with his
demon laughter; and then&mdash;then&mdash;the rage, the fear, the
baffled desire for the treasure&mdash;seem to combine to drive
one mad, so that this”&mdash;she shuddered as she pointed at
Otho’s still form&mdash;“comes naturally as the awful <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">finale</i>.
He&mdash;Otho&mdash;found it all out while seeking Floy, and persuaded
me to come with him to seek for the chests of
gold. Alas, alas!” and with a long, shuddering sigh she
closed her eyes again.</p>

<p>Alva stroked the dark tresses back from the damp
brow, and they looked at each other, she and St. George,
with wondering eyes that questioned:</p>

<p>“Can this story be true?”</p>

<p>The young man looked from the chamber of horror<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
out at the quiet sunset skies, and it seemed to him incredible
that such things could be.</p>

<p>But in the face of all that had gone before, and of this
present tragedy, he was not prepared to deny anything.
He could only say to Alva:</p>

<p>“It is a strange story.”</p>

<p>Everything began to grow dark in the room before
Maybelle spoke again.</p>

<p>She looked wistfully at Beresford, sighing:</p>

<p>“I do not wish to die now, though all the best things
of life have slipped away from me. But&mdash;but I seem
to be sinking away.”</p>

<p>“Have you any last words&mdash;any wish?” he began.</p>

<p>“Yes, one wish.” She seemed to forget Alva’s presence,
or not to care. “Will you&mdash;kiss me&mdash;just once?&mdash;I
have loved you so!”</p>

<p>Her voice was pathetic in its hopeless yearning, and
Alva motioned him to obey. She knew that noble little
Floy would not grudge this one caress to her dying rival.</p>

<p>So Beresford gave the one kiss that was a joyful memory
in all Maybelle’s future years.</p>

<p>For she did not die as she foreboded.</p>

<p>The room was filled presently with a curious crowd
who heard in wonder the strange story, and then carried
the dead and the living home again through the darkening
twilight.</p>

<p>Otho and his father were buried side by side, and kind
friends cared for the helpless Maury family. Mrs. Vere<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
de Vere, always Maybelle’s stanch friend, adopted the girl
as a daughter, so she never missed the wealth she prized
so much.</p>

<p>In time Maybelle made the grand match Mrs. Vere de
Vere had schemed for so long, but it was long years first,
and when she married the rich politician, it was for ambition,
not love. All her proud husband’s caresses were
not worth as much to her as the memory of one pitying
kiss.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">ALL THAT FLOY HAD LONGED FOR IN OTHER DAYS WAS HERS NOW.&mdash;LUCKY LITTLE MORTAL!</span></h2>


<p>The Beresfords returned to New York the next day
sick at heart and dispirited, for the mystery of Floy’s fate
was more inexplicable than ever.</p>

<p>In twenty-four hours after their return Lord Miller’s
card was received.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beresford was out, and St. George was ill again
from the fever of a baffled hope.</p>

<p>So Alva went down alone to meet the handsome Englishman,
and their mutual attraction toward each other
was strengthened by this interview.</p>

<p>His earnest sympathy with her brother tempted her to
confide the story of Floy to his sympathetic ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>He listened in wonder to it all, and then she ended
with a sigh:</p>

<p>“He is ill again, my poor brother, and no mortal physician
can heal the wound from which he suffers&mdash;the pain
of hopeless love.”</p>

<p>He looked at the bright, beautiful face, wondering how
she should know so much of what she spoke, then he
said, abruptly:</p>

<p>“I wonder if your brother would see me a little while
if I could give him good news?”</p>

<p>“Good news?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Yes, of this girl&mdash;this Floy Fane. I know where
she is to-day.”</p>

<p>Alva almost fainted with joy. He never forgot her
looks of gratitude and her expressions of joy.</p>

<p>“Come with me!” she cried; and led him to her
brother’s rooms.</p>

<p>“I have brought you a physician with news to make
you well!” she cried, radiantly, to the pale, languid invalid.</p>

<p>And then Lord Miller told them of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i> with
Floy the night of his return to New York, and his discovery
that she was his own child.</p>

<p>We must pass over their delight and amazement when
the romantic story was all told, and he ended by saying:</p>

<p>“I left Floy at the hotel, very busy looking over a few
thousand dollars’ worth of finery she purchased yesterday,<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
but if you both will return with me, I think she will
be glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“Are you well enough dear?” inquired Alva, looking
at her brother doubtfully.</p>

<p>He leaned upon her, his face flushed, his eyes alight
with joy.</p>

<p>“I am a new man. I do not feel as if I ever had been
ill,” he repeated, joyfully.</p>

<p>So leaving an explanation for their parents, should
they return in their absence, Alva and her brother accompanied
Lord Miller to the Fifth Avenue Hotel in
search of Floy.</p>

<p>“And to think how near she was to me while I was
breaking my heart over her loss!” thought the happy
lover.</p>

<p>He wondered if Floy would be glad to see him again,
and his heart throbbed a happy response. He had the
greatest confidence in his darling’s truth.</p>

<p>“Lady Florence is in her own parlor,” said the servant
whom Lord Miller asked for his daughter.</p>

<p>Lady Florence! How strange that sounded to Alva
and St. George! Yet it was her rightful title now.</p>

<p>Little Floy was never to know again the ills of poverty
and loneliness. All that she had sighed for in other days
was hers now&mdash;love, wealth, position. Lucky little mortal!</p>

<p>She had been amusing herself all day trying on her
new dresses and jewels, but after all they did not fill<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
her tender little heart. There was an ache there all the
time because of her grief for her fickle lover.</p>

<p>“I wish that he could see me now. This gown is so
becoming,” she thought, artlessly, rejoicing in the possession
of the cool white robe so soft and billowy in its
fine laces and streaming ribbons.</p>

<p>At that moment three people were at the door, and
Lord Miller opened it without knocking.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us wait outside!” cried Alva, with a romantic
impulse, drawing back as St. George crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Neither do we want to make a third at the reunion of
the long parted lovers, reader, so we will wait outside
with the other couple, for we can guess at all that passed.
Haven’t we all been there ourselves?</p>

<p>Ah! happy love! Is it not a foretaste of Paradise?</p>

<p>Lord Miller found that he had recovered his lovely
child only to lose her again.</p>

<p>St. George was the most persistent lover in the world.</p>

<p>He pleaded continually for an early marriage.</p>

<p>“Floy is nothing but a child, barely seventeen. Wait
till her eighteenth birthday,” answered the fond father.</p>

<p>The lover was most unhappy over the year’s probation.</p>

<p>“I can not bear to lose sight of my darling again. I
give you warning I shall follow you to England when
you take her away&mdash;ay, to the world’s end!” he protested.</p>

<p>Lord Miller answered, laughingly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>“I shall extend you a cordial invitation to be our guest
at our English home for as long as you please,” and with
that the lover had to be content, for even his own parents,
though they loved Floy so dearly, took part against him.</p>

<p>“It is right that her father should have her for a time,”
they said; and Floy, who adored her noble parent, was
well satisfied to have it so. She knew quite well, the
saucy little darling, that St. George would seldom be
absent from her side in that year of waiting.</p>

<p>They would not sail for their ancestral home until
October, anyway, for they had much to do in America.</p>

<p>For one thing, Lord Miller had to seek out his wife’s
neglected grave, and place a fitting monument above the
gentle heart that his father’s wickedness had driven wild
with despair. The thought of all she had suffered would
haunt Lord Miller with keen despair as long as he lived.</p>

<p>Then, too, a great force of men was put to work on
Suicide Place, to tear it down stone by stone to the
ground, that its haunting spirit should claim no more
maddened victims of the craze for gold. Even the grove
was hewn down, that the very site should be forgotten,
and Lady Florence presented the farm to Mount Vernon
to be turned into a pleasure park.</p>

<p>The chests of gold that had been seen in ghastly visions
of the night by so many poor victims were found to be
a reality.</p>

<p>They were walled up in stone beneath the brick flooring<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
of the cellar, and contained riches to the amount of
half a million.</p>

<p>It seemed like a ghastly legacy to Floy, and she tried
to atone for the sin of old Jasper Nellest, by devoting
more than half of it to works of charity.</p>

<p>She had seen so much of the world’s poverty and
sorrow while she was poor herself, that she knew how
to pity and sympathize, and, better still, to lend a helping
hand.</p>

<p>She did not neglect to search out the good Mrs. Banks,
who was now adrift on the world since poverty had fallen
on the Maury family, and oh! what joy it was to the kind
soul to see Floy again, whom she had mourned as dead.</p>

<p>She rejoiced unselfishly in the girl’s good fortune, and
wept when she clasped her in her arms, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“You shall come and live with me now, and be rich
and grand.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dearie, I could never go away from Mount
Vernon and my poor John’s grave!” she cried in her
simple, faithful fidelity.</p>

<p>Lady Florence wept with her as she answered:</p>

<p>“But I cannot stay here with you now, and I do so
want to make you happy. I have plenty of money, you
know, and I want to give you as much as you want.”</p>

<p>“God bless you, my sweet child, for your offer. It will
make my heart glad just to raise a pretty stone over my
husband’s grave, and to go back to live in the little cottage
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[223]</span></p>

<p>Lady Florence gratified her simple wishes, and settled
on her a sum of money that kept her in luxury a life-time,
with a stout servant to wait on her, and an elderly
cousin for a companion.</p>

<p>“And next year, you know, auntie, I am to have a
grand wedding at our English home, Earlscourt, and you
shall promise me now that you will cross the sea with the
Beresfords to see me married,” continued Lady Florence,
blushingly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Banks was very proud of the invitation, and many
good people in Mount Vernon envied her because she was
so loved by the earl’s fair daughter. They forgot that
she had earned it all by her goodness to the lonely orphan
child when her friends were few, and when they had
sneered at her girlish pranks and given her the soubriquet
of Fly-away Floy.</p>

<p>Lord Miller would be very lonely when his daughter
should leave him for her husband’s home, and one day,
when he was grieving over it, Floy, said, roguishly:</p>

<p>“Get Alva to stay with you when I come away. She
would make a magnificent countess.”</p>

<p>“The very thing that was in my mind,” he answered,
quickly; and before he left America he told Alva of his
wish.</p>

<p>“If you can be satisfied with a second love, I will make
you a devoted husband,” he said.</p>

<p>And Alva replied with a like confidence:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[224]</span></p>

<p>“My first love, too, is dead, but you have won my
heart. I believe that we can be very happy together,”
she admitted, frankly.</p>

<p>And because Lady Florence would need her so much
in the year before her marriage, she consented to an early
wedding, and sailed with them in October to her new
home far across the sea.</p>
